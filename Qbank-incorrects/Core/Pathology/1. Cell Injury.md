[[1 . Cell Injury]]
## Basic Concepts
> 55% | 47% | 25s /Q
- Lipids in the tissue are detected by Oil Red O (histologic stain) #histology
- Mallory bodies are composed of interwoven bundles of cytoskeletol intermediate filaments (cytokeratins)
- The pancreas of fetus (of diabetic mothers) may undergo hyperplasia due to increased demand.
			This is because islets of pancreas have proliferative capacity during fetal development
- Hydropic swelling reflects the acute, reversible cell injury
Plasma membrane sodium transport is impaired due to unavailability of ATP
- Cellular ageing is inflenced by:
	1.  DNA damage -> causes mutatuin
	2.  Telomere shortening -> cellular replication reduced -> cell loss
	3.  Defective protein homeostasis
	4.  Dysregulated nutrient sensing

## Reversible cell injury
>48% | 57% | 19 s/Q
- Breast does not undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia during lactation -> prolactin and estrogen only cause hypertrophy
	- However during pregnancy and puberty it does undergo both

- In Fenton reaction, iron is converted from ferrous to ferric form, and a hydroxyl radical is generated

- Pleomorphic adenoma are the most common salivary gland neoplasms
	- Mixed tumor - Epithelial + Mesenchymal component
	- Warthin tumor is the 2nd most common neoplasm
	- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of salivary glands
- Ground glass hepatocytes are seen in chronic hepatits B
	- Autoimmune hepatitis features
		1. Autoantibodies
		2. IgG level increased (1.1x)
		3. Histology of liver
		 	- In interface hepatitis: Lymphocytic/lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in portal cells and extending in the lobule
		 	- Emperipolesis: Active penetration by one cell into another and through a larger cell (cell within a cell)
			 - Hepatic rosette formation
		4. Absence of viral hepatits


- Kayorrhexis is a feature of necrosi (irreversible cell injury)
- Inflammasome is mediated by IL-1β
	- It's a cytosolic multiprotein complex consisting of NLRP-3 sensor, an adaptor and inactive Caspase-1 enzyme	
	- It's triggered by NOD-like receptors (NLRs) that sense the ingested microbial particles
	- NLRs signals activate IL-1β, cleaving it from precursor form -> biologically active form

## Basic Concepts
- Lipids in the tissue are detected by Oil Red O (histologic stain)
- Mallory bodies are composed of interwoven bundles of cytoskeletol intermediate filaments (cytokeratins)
- The pancreas of fetus (of diabetic mothers) may undergo hyperplasia due to increased demand.
			This is because islets of pancreas have proliferative capacity during fetal development
- Hydropic swelling reflects the acute, reversible cell injury
Plasma membrane sodium transport is impaired due to unavailability of ATP
- Cellular ageing is inflenced by:
	1.  DNA damage -> causes mutatuin
	2.  Telomere shortening -> cellular replication reduced -> cell loss
	3.  Defective protein homeostasis
	4.  Dysregulated nutrient sensing

## Reversible cell injury

# Introduction
- Inflammation is the response of vascularized connective tissue
- Injury -> Response of Body
	1.  Change in Blood Vessels
	2.  Changes in Cells [Connective tissue]
- This response is usually protective, but sometimes harmful
- *-itis* denotes inflammation </br>

- Types
	- Purulent infl. 
	- Serous infl.
	- Fibrinous
	- Cattarhal inflammation [Inflammation involving mucous membrane - discharge of watery + mucous **Most common**]


- Acute Inflammation -> Neutrophils
- Chronic Inflammation -> Mononuclear WBCs (lymphocytes with their *round* nucleus and monocytes with *kidney* shaped nucleus)

Cardinal signs of inflammation: [Described by Celsus]
Rubor
Dolor
Calor
Tumor
*Funcio lassiea* / Loss of function - Virchow

# Acute Inflammation
## Vascular changes
1. Vasoconstriction is the first/earliest change during inflammation
2. Vasodilation due to release of due to release of inflammatory mediators such as **Histamine**
	- Responsible for rubor due to **hyperemia**
	- Responsible for calor
3. Increased vascular permeability
	- This is primarily due to endothelial **cell contraction** and increased gap between endothelial cells from vasodilation due to chemical mediators
	- This leads to formation of exudate (protein and cell rich fluid)
		- Fluids
		- Cells
		- Proteins
	- Specific gravity of Exudate is greater than 1.020 -> This leads to swelling/edema [**Tumor**]
	- Small blood vessels such as below, can also be involved
		- Arterioles
		- Capillaries
		- Venules (most commonly involved)
4. Stasis
	- This is reduction in velocity of blood flow
	- This is due to increased vascular permeability which leads to hemoconcentration -> Viscosity increases
	- Due to stasis, there is inceased chances of thrombosis due to settling down of platelets and clotting factors
	- VIRCHO'S TRIAD - Associated with **Thrombus formation**
	- ![[Pasted image 20210624234922.png]]
		1. Endothelial cell injury
		2. Changes in blood flow -> if increased speed -> turbulence -> endothelial cell damage
		3. Hypercoagulability
	

### Mechanisms of Vascular permeability

- This is the most characteristic change in inflammation

1. Endothelial cell contraction - *MOST COMMON*
	- due to action of histamine
	- immediate **transient** (lasting only for a short time; impermanent.)
	- e.g. thorn prick
2. Direct endothelial cell injury
	- Massive release of toxins causing damage to endothelial cells
	- Since repair of these endothelial cells take time, it is an immediate but sustained response 
	- e.g: Septicemia, Severe burn
3. Endothelial cell retraction
	- It is mediated by cytokines (which are usually released after inflammation)
	- This is re-organization of ECs
	- Thus it is delayed **transient** change
	- e.g: bacterial infections
4. Endothelial cell Damage
	- Gradual damage occurs
	- Thus it is **Delayed prolonged** leakage
	- e.g: late sun burn

- The extracellular fluid is drained by lymph
- During exudate release, bacteria/toxins may also be  released, thus this may enter the lymph
- This causes lymphangitis (inflammation of lymph vessels)
	- Most common infection for lymphangitis: *Streptococcus pyogenes*
	![[Pasted image 20210624234404.png]]
	- Notice the thin red lines along the lymph vessels visible superficially

- Regulation
- Repair

### Intravascular Changes
![[Pasted image 20210627075405.png]]
1. Margination - WBCs start to move o margins when inflammation occurs
	- Neutrophils have 2 pools - 50% on margination pool, 50% in systemic circulation
	- Laminar Flow Theory: Cells tend to move in the center while fluid moves in the periphery
2. Rolling, a.k.a Loose Adhesion -  slowing down of WBC 
	- Endothelial cells express Selectins (CD62)
		- E -> expressed on surface of Endothelial cells | Induced by TNF and IL-1
		- P -> expressed on Platelets, and Endothelial cells - mediated by histamine 
			-  It is pressent in a low-energy state during non-inflammatory conditions as **W**eibel-**P**alade Body as an intracellular body
			- It is expressed during inflammation onto the surface of endothelial cell
			- It contains Willebrand factor and selectins
		- L -> expressed on Leukocytes (WBCs)
	- WBCs express Siayl-Lewis-X (sugar moiety/molecule)
	- ![[Pasted image 20210627075611.png]]
	- This reduces the speed of WBCs

3.  Adhesion | Firm Adhesion
	- WBCs express Integrins, a.k.a CD11a / LFA1 (Lymphoctes), CD11b /Mac1 (Macrophages) - upregulated by LTB4 and C5a
	- Endothelial cells express:
		- **ICAM**: Inter Cellular Adhesion Molecule
		- **VCAM**: Vascular Cellular Adhesion Molecule
		- Upregulated by TNF and IL1

>   **Leukocyte adhesion deficiency**-
> Most commonly due to an autosomal recessive defect of integrins (CD18 subunit)
>
>Presentation- Late separation (>30 days) of umbilical cord, **absent pus**, dysfunctional neutrophils, recurrent skin and mucosal bacterial infections.
>Finding - increased neutrophils in blood, Absence of neutrophils at infection sites, impaired wound healing
>LAD I - Malfunctioning of Integrins [CD11a/CD11b -3 LFA-1] - FIRM ADHENSION - DELAYED UMBLICAL CORD SEPERATION
>LAD II - malfunctioning of selectin receptors (Siayl-Lewis molecule) - LOOSE ADHESION 
	> -Fucosyl trasferase defect -> Leads to defect of H-antigen and other sugar groups such as Siayl-Lewis molecule
	> - Decreased Growth (e.g. short stature), No H-Antigen at all -> Bombay Blood Group
> ![[Pasted image 20210627101852.png]]

4. Transmigration/Diapedesis
- It requires CD31 [PECAM - Platelet Endotelial Cell Adhesion Molecule]
	- It is present on both the neutrophil and endothelial cell thus the interaction is homotypic interaction homotypic interaction
- Predominant involvement of venules **except** Pulmonary Circulation ***(in capilaries)***

![[Pasted image 20210627110756.png]]
- An important component of Basement membrane called Laminin and Collagen IV
- Collagenase is secreted by WBCs and is responsible for breaking of collagen of Basement Membrane

- Normal transmigration of Neutrophil occur for 24 hrs followed by monocytes except:
	-  In parasitic infections- eosinophils
	- In viral infections - lymphocyted
	- In Pseudomonas infection - Neutrophils transmigrate for 2-4 days

### Extracellular Vascular Changes

5. Chemotaxis
	- Chemotaxis is the unidirectional movement of WBC towards bacteria 
	- Chemicals responsible - exogenous (bacterial products) and Endogenous
		1. C5a [Complement Protein]
		2. IL-8 [Interleukin]
		3. LT-B4 [Leukotriene]
	- Chemotaxis may damage tissue
	- Steroids inhibit Chemotaxis

6. Phagocytosis
	1. Recognition of target cells
		- WBCs express Mannose-binding receptors [Binding to mannose on microbes]
		- Scavenger Receptors: [Binds to other practicals]
		- Process of phagocytosis is facilitated by OPSONIZATON
			- The bacteria is covered by opsonins (chemicals) -> leads to preferential killing of cells
				- Fc fragmennt of IgG
				- C3b
				- Fibrinogen 
				- C-reactive protein
				> ![[Pasted image 20210627203200.png]]
				> It leads to defective opsonization
				- C-Reactive Protein: reacts to C - Carbohydrate antigen of bacteria like streptococcus pneumonia
	2. Engulfment
		- Pseudopod formation due to actin polymerization
		- The target is internalized and forms phagosome
	4. Killing of bacteria
		 - Phagosome is transferred to Lysosome
		 - Transport is due to LYST - lysosomal transfer protein
		 - Phagosome and lysosome is then fused

	> Defect of LysT
	> CHEDIAK-HIGASHI SYNDROME
	> - LysT protein is needed for Neutrophils, platelets, melanocytes, activity of Myelin (neurological)
	> - Due to this defect, there are presence of granular phagosomes in the cells -> seen in peripheral smear
	> ![[Pasted image 20210627204435.png]]
	> C - CNS
	> HE - HEmorrhage
	> D - Decrease
	> I		Immunity
	> A - Albinism
	> K


## Oxygen Independent Killing
ACHIEVED WITH THE HELP OF Secondary granules of Leukocytes 
1. CATHELICIDIN - Related to Vitamin D *EJSEXPAND*
2.  LYSOZYMES
3.  LACTOFERRIN -> reason for lesser infections of infants
4. MAJOR BASIC PROTEIN
	- abundant in EOSINOPHILS
	- **parasitic** killing
5. Defensins - Arginine rich molecules with antibacterial action


## Oxygen dependent
- This is more efficient in killing
- Killing of bacteria -> Lysosomal formaion -> O2 for killing -> respiratory burst
- NO -> Peroxynitrate Mechanism
	- Most important in macrophage, esp. myocobacterral infections
	- Oxidized by superoxide

2. NADPH oxidase mechanism
	- NADPH oxudase Converts O2 to Superoxide
	- Superoxide converts to hydrogen peroxide
		- H202 is acted upon by Myeloperoxidase Enzyme in presence of halide -> hypohalus radical
			- MPO-Halide system is the most bactericidal way utilized by neutrophils
			- If MPO deficiency occurs, hydroxyl radicals are formed -> Not very severe
			  - It increases susceptibility to Candida infections, however, it is asymptomatic
			
		- H202 may be converted OH- radical
	- Hypochlorous radical -> destructive
	- Thus WBCs require more O2 during inflammation -> thus named Respiratory Burst Oxidase and Phagocyte Oxidase

### Chronic granulomatous disease
- It is due to deficiency of NADPH Oxidase defect
	1. X-linked Recessive (more common)
		- Membrane bound component is defective | GP91 PHOX (PhagocyteOxidase)
	2. Autosomal Recessive 
		- Cytosomal component defect
		- gp47 PHOX defect
		- gp67 PHOX defect
- Granulomas are formed in different organs (lungs, liver, lymph nodes, GIT)
- Recurrent Infections, especially by catalase positive organisms
	e.g:  - Staph. aureus
			- Aspergillious
			- Pseudomonas *cepacia*
			- Candida
			- Nocardia

>![[Pasted image 20210629234837.png]]
>Nitro-blue Tetrazolium
>***POSITIVE*** is for normal individuals
>  
> - DHR test -  Flow cytometry
> - Cyt-C reduction assay test - quantitative  test

Rx 
- Bone Marrow Transplant
- IFN-gamma -> activates macrophages
- Broad spectrum antibiotics & antifungals

### Neutrophil Extracellular Trap
- Extracellular fibrillary network
- Stimuli
	- Infectious pathogens
		- TLRs of Platelets are activated by microbes -> activation of neutrophils/macrophages
	- Inflamatory mediators 
		- Activation of neutrophils

- ROS activates Arginine Deiminase, converting Arginine to Citroline
![[Pasted image 20210628183909.png]]
- Chromatin decondensation in neutrophils during sepsis (large bacterial load) and some fungal infections,
	- This is due to overwhelmed presence since engulfment will not work
	- Chromatin comes out of nucleus and act as trap for bacteria
	- However death of neutrophil occurs
	- Risk of Autoimmune diseases (due to formation of antinuclear antibodies due to release of chromatin), e.g, **SLE**

## Chemical Mediators

### Chemical mediators in Plasma

#### Kinin System
Injury to  blood vessel -> XII ->XIIa
Pre-Kallikrein -> [XIIa] ->Kallikrein
- Activation of Bradykinin
- Activation of Complement system
- Activation of Plasminogen - Plasmin

Kininogen -> [Kallikrein]  -> Bradykinin
- Venular permeability (postcapillary venules) - incresased
- Pain
- Vasodilation
- Bronchospasm

- drycough is due to vasospasm caused by increased bradykinin
	- Angioedema

#### Complement System
- These are a group of more than 20 proteins
- Responsible for immunity
	- Activated by both innate and adaptive
- Regulates normal function

##### Classical Pathway 
GM Manufactures Classic Cars - IgG and **IgM**
- Adaptive Immunity
- IgM is more important 
	- IgG1 IgG2 Ig3 can activate complement system
		- IgG4 cannot - LOW-YIELD

- C1 -> [Immunoglobulin] -> Activated C1
	- C2a + C4b -> [Activated C1] -> C4b2a **(C3 Convertase)**
	- C3b -> [C3 Convertase - C4b2a] -> C4b2a3b **(C5 Convertase)**
	- C5 -> [C5 Convertase] -> C5b + C6-C9 **Membrane Attack Complex**


##### Lectin pathway
- Mannose-binding lectin -> Activating C4
- C1-like complex instead of C1
- C4 is the first component that's activated
- Rest is similar to Classical Pathway

##### Alternate Pathway
- Innate immunity
- Activated by
	- Endotoxins (LPS)
	- Venom
	- IgA IgD very rarely
- C3 -> [Hydrolysis] -> C3b
	- C3b + Bb -> [Factor D] -> C3Bb [C3 convertase]
	- 3b -> [C3 convertase - C3bBb] -> C3bBb3b **(C5 Convertase)**


> Pathway that is activated can be diagnosed by assessing Complement proteins levels and mark those that have decreased

| C1/C2/C4 [Early Proteins]     | Autoimmune Disorders (SLE)                            |
| C3                            | Pyogenic infections                                   |
| C5/C6/C7/C8 [Late Proteinas]  | Increased susceptibility to Neisseria - Toxoplasmosis |
| C9                            | No significant effect                                 |


##### Regulation

1. C1 Inhibitor
	- Blocks activation of C1
	- Deficiency leads to:
		1. Increased C1 Activation
		2. Release of C3a/C5a
		3. Hereditary Angioneurotic Edema
		- Females are more susceptible
		- Edema - Non pitting -> in face/cutaneous tissue
		- Laryngeal edema/GIT -> Emergency

2. CD46/Factor H Factor
	- Controls the alternate pathway
	- Deficiency leads to increased complement system activation
		- -> Endothelial Cell Damage -> Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS]
		- Age Related Macular Degeneration is also associated
		
3. CD55/CD59
	- present on normal blood cell: prevent RBC/WBC/platelets from damage by Complement system
	- Deficiency occurs -> Decreased RBC/WBC/Platelets
		- -> Pancytopenia -> Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria


# Chronic Inflammation
- This is an ongoing prolonged inflammation
- Associated with tissue destruction
> Hallmark: Tissue Destruction
- Associated with repair/healing

Monoblast -> Monocyte -> Macrophage
Bone	  	  -> Blood 		  -> Tissue

- Macrophage survives for a much longer duration
![[Pasted image 20210701093452.png]]

Types:
- M1: Activated by Interferon-gamma - secreted by CD8 T Cells and Th1 -> **Pro-inflammatory**
- M2: Activated by IL-4, IL13 - secreted by Th2 -> **Anti-inflammatory**

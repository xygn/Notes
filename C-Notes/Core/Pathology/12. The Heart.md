”Ischemic heart disease represents a group of pathophysiologically
related syndromes resulting from myocardial ischemia—an imbalance
between myocardial supply (perfusion) and cardiac demand for
oxygenated blood”

- most common: blockage of coronary vessels
- decade long progression

Clinical manifestation

- Myocardial indfarction - ischemia causing cardiac necrosis
- Angina pectoris - Ischemia is not severe enough to cause necrosis
- chronic Ischemic heart disease with heart disease
- Sudden cardiac **death**

Ischemic Heart Disease - Acute Coronary Syndrome
1. Unstable Angina Pectoris
2. Myocardial Infarction
3. Sudden Cardiac Death
- Due to sudden change in atherosclerotic plaque

Etiology
- Atherosclerosis
- Emboli
- Myocardial vessel inflammation
- Vascular Spasm
- Systemic hypotension
- Increased demand - Myocardial Hypertrophy and increased heart rate

Epidemiology:
- Similar to etiology of Atherosclerois
- Decreasing trend due to better prevention
- Better diagnostic and

Pathogenesis
- 90% - Atherosclerosis
- CAD - Coronary Artery Disease
- Progressive narrowing leading to stenosis -> fixed obstruction
- Acute plaque change with thrombosis
- Fixed obstruction more than 75% significant CAD
- Threshold for sympotomatic ischemia are precipitated by exercise
- Obstruction of 90% cross-sectional area - inadequate coronary flow even during rest
- Collaterals :Progressive ischemia induced by slowly developing occlusion.
- Single or two to three coronary vessels may be involved(LAD, LCX
and RCA) I!

Acute Plaque Change:
- Abrupt conversion of stable plaque to unstable atherothrombotic lesion
-

Consequences of Ischemia


Angina



## Patterns of Infarction
- It is dependent on the perfusion pattern
	- Subendocardial zone is the least supplied part of the coronary arteries, thus it is most susceptible to ischemia
	- It progresses towards epicardium as the ischemia persists
- Transmural Infarction
	- Occlusion of epicardial vessels in absence of intervention
	- ST elevation MI 
- Non-transmural infarct
	- A.k.a Sub-endocardial infarction
	- 

Coronary Blood Supply
- Dominant artery is determined by coronary artery that supplies posterior third of septum (RCA vs Left Circumflex)
	- Right dominant in **80%**
	- LAD and LCX supply majority of **LV**
- Left ventricle/septum commonly involved
	- Right and left ventricle-RCX
- Isolated right ventricle/atria is unusual (1% to 3%)

## Morphology
- Gross annd microscopic appearance of an infarct
- Depend on duration of survival of patient following MI (should survive for a certain duration after MI - **Morphological changes are not seen for sudden death**)
- Progressive sequence of morphologic changes
- Coagulative necrosis, Inflammation and repair
### Gross features
- MI <12 hours old - not grossly apparent
	- MI >3 hours - Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTF) a dye that colors of non-infarcted part of the heart as it demonstrates color only for parts that contain LDH
	- ![[Pasted image 20210623091850.png]]
- MI >12 hours - microscopic features
	- Reversible
		- None [0-30 minutes]
	- Irreversible
		- None [30 to 4 hours]
		- Dark mottling (occasional) [4 to 12h]
		- Dark mottling [12-24h]
		- Mottling with yellow-tan infarct
		- Hyperemic border, central-yellow tan softening
		- Maximally, yellow-tan and soft, with depressed red-tan margins
		- Red-gray depressed infarct borders
		- Gray-white scar,progressive from border toward core 
		- Scarring complete [> 2 months]

### Microscopy
- Visible after 4 to 6 hours
	- Early coagulation necrosis; edema; hemorrhage

> Gross and morphological changes based on time is very important for the exam

## Clinical Features
- Characterized by severe, radiating, crushing substernal chest pain that can radiate to the neck, jaw, epigastrium or left arm
- Several minutes to hours
- Not releibved by rest or nitroglycerin
- Silent MIs in DM and elderly patients
- Nausea, vommiting heart burn

### ECG
- ST-segment


### Laboratory Evaluation
- Cardiac Troponins; cTnT and CtNi
	- Detected after 2-4 hours
	- Peaks at 48 hours
	- levels remain elevated for 7 to 10 days
	- not useful for re-infarction
- Creatinine KInase: CK-MB
	- Detectable after 2-4h
	- Peak at 24-48h
	- useful for detecting re-infarction

### Complications
Minutes/Hours
1. *Arrythmias*- usually ventricular fibrillation
2. Cardiac Failure
3. Cardiogenic shock is seen in massive MI (>40% of left ventricle infarcted)
4. Pulmonary edema of cardiogenic ratio

Days
1. Thrombosis (over infarct area) -> Thromboembolism
2. Rupture of heart (Wall/septum/papillary muscle) - Most commonly affected: Left Anterolateral wall of the left ventricle

Week/Months
1. Dressler's syndrome
2. Cardiac Aneurysm (Ventricular wall aneurysm - more associated)

## Reperfusion Injury 

- Restoration of blood flow to ischemic myocardium
- Occurs due to oxidative stress from incomplete reduction in leukocytes and cells and intracellular calcium overload
- Salvage myocardium at risk and limit infarct size
- Impacts short and long time function
- 3-4 hours critical
- Thrombolysis - Removes only thrombus
- Angioplasty - removes thrombus and clears atherosclerotic lesions
- Coronary bypass - When multiple vessels are affected

- Vascular injury and leakiness is seen in repurfusion injury
- May lead to hypercontraction bands that appear as hypereosinophillic 

Thus reperfusion is beneficial but can trigger complications
May lead to arrythmias or reperfusion injury

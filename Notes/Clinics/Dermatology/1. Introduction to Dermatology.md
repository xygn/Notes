## Anatomy of Skin

-   Largest organ system
-   Measures about 2.12 sq m 
-   Weighing 4-5 (16% body weight) kg
-   Presence of sebaceous, eccrine glands, hair, nails, mucous membrane


### Embryology
 
- All constituents are derived from ectoderm and mesoderm
- Ectoderm and mesoderm begin to proliferate and differentiate at 4th week of intrauterine life
- The specialized structures of skin, teeth, hair, nails and glands begin to appear at this time

### Layers of skin

1. Epidermis
2. Dermis
3. Hypodermis

#### Epidermis:

>Deep -> superficial
Boy, - Basale
Some - Spinosum
Girls - Granulosum
Look - Lucidum
Cute - Corneum

Made of stratified squamous epithelium

##### Stratum basale
- a.k.a Stratum germinatum
- Single layer of columnar cells (central nucleus)

##### Stratum spinosum
-   Thickest layer of epidermis
-   Spine like process
-   A.k.a Prickle cell layer
-   Spine-like processes are desmosomes  
    Desmosomes are intraepidermal intercellular connection

-  ** Applied aspect**
Pemphigus group of disorder - antibodies targets desmosomes leading to lysis of attachment

	Above 2 layers together are the Malphigian layer - a layer in which cells continuously divide
	
##### Stratum granulosum

1.  Keratohyaline granules -> Profilagrin -> Filagrin 
2.  Lamellar granules a.k.a Cementosomes/Odland body  
    Responsible for production of lipid -> barrier function of skin
	
##### Stratum lucidum
Translucent layer
-  Eleidin granules are present
- Present only in palms and soles

##### Stratum corneum
1.  Flat cells
2.  Fully keratinised
3.  Nucleus is not present - dead

   

##### Transitional changes form S. Basale -> S. corneum:
----------------------------------------------------

-   Shape -> Flattening
-   Nucleus -> Disappearance in S. corneum
-   Keratin -> increases
-   Water -> decreases (dehydration)
-   Epidermal transitional time (basale -> corneum): 28 days/4 weeks  
    In disorders like Psoriasis ETT is 3 to 5 days

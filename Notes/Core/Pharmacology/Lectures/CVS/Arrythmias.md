Physiologically:
- Contractile
- Pacemaker/Conducting 

Electrophysiologically:
- SLow conducting
- Fast conducting

Channels:
Different types
L type @ -40mV
T type calcium
voltage K+ 

Events of polarity in Nodal Tissue
- @-40mV rapid depolarization
- Phase 1
- Phase 2
- Phase 3

Resting MP of myocyte - -90mV
of Nodal tissue -60 mV

Events of polarity in Myocyte
- when action potential is triggered in neighboring cells, sodium rushes into the RP
- Phase 4
- Phase 0
- Phase 1
- Phase 2

Antiarrythmics - try to normalize ionic fluxes

WHat is arrythmia??

Broadly classified as:
1. Bradyarrythmia
2. Tachyarytmia (greater than 100 beats)

Ectopic impulse

Abnormal secondary abstrokes that occur after triggered beat is called a trigerred beat
A triggered beat is seen even before cell reaches depolarization

Delayed after depolarization
- A beat that is delayed for a while even after depolarization

### Anatomicaly defined Reentry
What is it?
A re-entrance circuit either due to anatomical reasons or physiologic
- an anatomical barrier leads to occurrence as an accessory pathway
Accessory pathway connects atrium and ventricle
Pathway is different from normal one (AV/Purkinje system)
As a result, rhythm of heart is affected due to reentry of impulses even before next Action potential is generated.

### Functionally defined Rentry
What is it?
- There is no fixed pathway/accessory tissue
- A premature impulse travels through inhomogenous medium causing a differing velocity
- There could be multiple functional foci
- Causes:

### Re-entry phenomenon
1. PH
2. PH
3. PH
4. PH

### Intiation of rentry
PH

## Types of Arythmias
- Supraventricular
Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial Flutter
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
- Ventricular
Ventricular fibrillation and flutter
Ventricular tachycardia

Extra-systoles: ????

# Classification of Anti-arrythmics
1. Sodium channel blocker
	- Class IA
	- Class IB
	- Class IC
2. Beta blockers
3. Agent widening action potential
4. Calcium channel blockers
Actions may overlap and not be a sole ion channel blocker. - multiple actions

## How do they work:
- Change shape of Cardiac AP
- PH

### Class 1: Sodium channel blocker
#### Class 1A

#### Class IB
 - Safer than 1A

#### Class 1C

### Class 2: Beta blockers
### Class 3: Agent widening action potential

### Miscellaneous
- Adenosine
- Atropine
- Digitalis
- MgSO4
- Evabradine
- Adrenaline

Choice of drug varies with type of arrythmias and toxicity
**All arrythmias need not be treated**

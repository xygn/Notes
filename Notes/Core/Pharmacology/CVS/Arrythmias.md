Physiologically:
- Contractile
- Pacemaker/Conducting 

Electrophysiologically:
- SLow conducting
- Fast conducting

Channels:
Different types
L type @ -40mV
T type calcium
voltage K+ 

Depolarization: Entry through Na+ at resting stage
Hyperpolarization -> Exit of K+ through K+ channel at resting stage
Repolarization -> Exit of K+ through K+ channel at Depolarized state

Events of polarity in Nodal Tissue
- @-40mV rapid depolarization
- Phase 4 -  Phase 4 is not resting, because of funny current due to leakage of Na+ into the cells until it depolarizes
- Phase 0 - L-type Calcium channels open -> Inward current -> Leads to depolarization 
- Phase 3 - K+ Channels open -> outward current -> repolarization
![[Pasted image 20210620155626.png | 400]]
- **In AV Node**, Phase 4 is slower
- SA node is dominant due to it's quicker Phase 4

Resting MP of myocyte - -90mV
of Nodal tissue -60 mV

Events of polarity in Myocyte
- Phase 4 - Closed Na+ and Ca++ (resting state) [There's a constant outward leak of K+]
- When action potential is triggered in neighboring cells, sodium rushes into the RP through the gap junctions
- Phase 0 - Na+ opens [CLASS 1 AR]
- Phase 1 - Na+ closes, K+ opens
- Phase 2 - Opening of K+ and L-type Calcium channel -> Inward **Ca2+** current which is the trigger for myocyte contraction
- Phase 3 - Continuous exit of K+ channel, calcium channel closed

> P wave - Atrial depolarization

- AV block - causes *Bradycardia*

Antiarrythmics - try to normalize ionic fluxes

WHat is arrythmia??

Broadly classified as:
1. Bradyarrythmia
2. Tachyarytmia (greater than 100 beats)

Ectopic impulse

Abnormal secondary abstrokes that occur after triggered beat is called a trigerred beat
A triggered beat is seen even before cell reaches depolarization

Delayed after depolarization
- A beat that is delayed for a while even after depolarization

### Anatomicaly defined Reentry
What is it?
A re-entrance circuit either due to anatomical reasons or physiologic
- an anatomical barrier leads to occurrence as an accessory pathway
Accessory pathway connects atrium and ventricle
Pathway is different from normal one (AV/Purkinje system)
As a result, rhythm of heart is affected due to reentry of impulses even before next Action potential is generated.

### Functionally defined Rentry
What is it?
- There is no fixed pathway/accessory tissue
- A premature impulse travels through inhomogenous medium causing a differing velocity
- There could be multiple functional foci
- Causes:

### Re-entry phenomenon
1. PH
2. PH
3. PH
4. PH

### Intiation of rentry
PH

## Types of Arythmias
- Supraventricular
Atrial Fibrillation
	- Irregularly irregular pulse
	- Baseline in EKG is wavy 
	- Absence of clearly defined P-wave
Atrial Flutter
Paroxysmal (comes and goes) supraventricular tachycardia
- Ventricular
Ventricular fibrillation and flutter
Ventricular tachycardia

Extra-systoles: ????

## Treatment
- Na+ blockers decreases slope(dv/dt) of Phase 0 
- K+ blockers increases the AP duration (QT interval increased) 
- K+ openers decrease the AP duration (QT interval)
> **Torsades' de pointes** - twisting of the points
> - Uncommon and distinctive form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)
	

# Classification of Anti-arrythmics
***Vaughan William Classification***
1. [[#Class 1 Sodium channel blocker]]
	- [[#Class 1A]]
	- [[#Class IB]]
	- [[#Class 1C]]
2. [[#Class 2 Beta blockers]]
3. [[#Class 3 Agent widening action potential]]
4. [[#Class 4 Calcium channel blocker]]
5. [[#Class 5 Miscellaneous]]
Actions may overlap and not be a sole ion channel blocker. - multiple actions

## How do they work:
- Change shape of Cardiac AP
- PH

### Class 1: Sodium channel blocker
#### Class 1A
1A -> Blocks K+ channels
includes:
- Quinidine
- Procainamide

>Mmeonic: QP - Queen Prince
#### Class IB
 - 1B -> Opens K+ channels
 - Safer than 1A
 - **Useful only ventricular arrythmias**
 Includes: 
- Lignocaine - DOC for Ventricular arrythmias
- Phenytoin
- Tocainide

>Blowjob category:
>Lig - lick
>Pheny - penis
>Toca - (with) tongue
#### Class 1C
- 1C -> No effects K+
Includes - 
- Encainide
- Flecainide
- Propafenone

### Class 2: Beta blockers
- Used in tachychardias and tachyarrythmias
- Modify slope of Phase 4 of Nodal tissue
- Lesser slope leads to slower heart rate
- Also prolongs repolarization
- AV node conduction is slowed
- ![[Pasted image 20210620160340.png]]
### Class 3: Agent widening action potential
- Mostly potassium channel blockers
- Action potential increased
Includes: 
- Bretylium [previously used as defibrillator pharmacologically]
- Ibutilide [Atrial fibrillation]
- Dofetlide [Atrial birallation]
- Amiodarone [Longest acting AA drug w/ t-half | Omni-AA because it has mechanism all classes]
- Sotalol [It's a beta blocker that has **dual mechanism**]
BInDAS
>Adverse effects of Am**iod**arone: 
> The: Thyroid - can cause both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism (x Dronedarone doesn't contain iodine but is less effective)
> Periphery: Peripheral neuropathy
> My: Myocardial depression
> Lung: *Lung fibrosis*
> Liver: Hepatotoxic
> Cornea: Corneal deposits
> Photosensitive: Rashes on skin | May lead to Blue-man syndrome

Other pulmonary fibrosis causing drugs:
>- Cyclophosphamide
>- Busulfan
>- Methotrexate
>- Amiodarone
>- Bleomycin
> All are transport modes that can blow horn - Cycle, Bus, Metho-TRUCK-sate, D-a-RONE, BLEOing horn

### Class 4: Calcium channel blocker
L type - calcium channel
Ver - heart and blood vessels
Dil - heart and blood vessels 
Dihydropyridines - blood vessels only

Used in tachyarythmias
- Beta blockers and Class 4 drugs must not be combined as there's a severe risk of brachycardia and depression 
### Class 5: Miscellaneous
- Adenosine - Shortest half-life (<10s) | DOC in PSVT 
Due to it's half life, it is given as a rapid IV push in the central veins (jugular vein)
>(Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (**PSVT**) is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia. It occurs when a short circuit rhythm develops in the upper chamber of the heart. This results in a regular but rapid heartbeat that starts and stops abruptly.)
- Atropine - used in Bradycardia (anti-cholinergic effect) and AV block - DOC
- Digitalis
- Digoxin - used for Atrial fibrillation (decreases conduction between atria and ventricle, decreasing increase in ventricular rate)
- MgSO4 - DOC for Torsades de Pointes/ Long QT Intervals 
- Evabradine
- Adrenaline

Choice of drug varies with type of arrythmias and toxicity
**All arrythmias need not be treated**

# Introduction
>**H** - Hypoxic Hypoxia
**A** - Anemic Hypoxia
**S** - Stagnant Hypoxia
**H** - Hostotoxic Hypoxia

-  Low partial pressure of O2 in blood - **HYPOXEMIA** SaO2 is < 90 % PaO2 < 60mmHg |||| SaO2 - percentage of RBC bound to O2 ||| PaO2 - pressure of O2 inside arterioles
 ![[Pasted image 20210618183900.png | 250]]

### Hypoxia

**Hypoxic hypoxia** - less O2 enters the blood stream due to
  
- less partial pressure of O2'
- Pulmonary pathology impairing diffusion
	• High altitudes   
	• ILD Interstitial Lung Disease)   	
	• Right  -> Left Shunt

#### Anemic hypoxia
Anemic Hypoxia - functional Hb is reduced in number
E.g:
- Altered Hb 
- CO poisonig -> CO-Hb **headache**, ***cherry red color*** present
- Met-Hb - ![[Pasted image 20210618184600.png]]
		- Associated with Cyt B5 reductase deficiency
		- Fe2 binds O2 -> Met-Hb has Fe3
		- **Chocolate colored blood** with cyanosis
		- Methemoglobemia is treated with **Methylene Blue IV** and vitamin C

- PaO2 and SaO2 is normal (as SaO2 is qualitative rather than quantitative) in quantiative anemias, while SaO2 is decreased in qualitative anemias


## Reversible injury
___
> Hallmark: Cellular swelling

e.g. Angina

**Mitochondria** is the first organelle that's affected from hypoxia, leading to decreased ATP.
	- Cell Membrane
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- Misc. Changes
	- Amorphous/mitochondrial density occurs due to calcium accumulation due to decreased ATP
	
// **Cell Membrane**:
- Na+K+ Pump reduced
	- Na+ increased
	- Water content inside increased as water follows
- Leads to Cellular Swelling (hydropic change) - 1st microscopic feature
	- Bleb formation
	- Microvilli formation
- Myelin figures | denatured phospholipid from cell membrane or membrane of organelles
	- Seen in ICM and ECM
	- Resembles of Myelin sheath surrounding neuron ![[Pasted image 20210618190851.png]]

// **Endoplasmic Reticulum**
Decreased ATP leads to
- Swelling of the RER
	- Ribosome breaks away (polyribosomes become monoribosomes)
	- Decreased protein synthesis
- Accumulation of misfolded proteins due to loss/impaired secondary and tertiary structures

// **Miscellaneous changes**
- Increased glycolysis (anaerobic pathway) leading to decreased glycogen
	- Increased accumulation of lactic acid and pyruvic acid leading of Acidosis
Nuclear changes:
- Chromatin clumping due to acidosis ![[Pasted image 20210618191049.png]]
- Liver becomes fatty

## Irreversible Cell Injury
_____

> Hallmark: Membrane damage of:
> 1. Plasma membrane
> 2. Inner mitochondrial membrane
> 3. Lysosome membrane

e.g: Myocardial Infarction
Two important patterns
1. Apoptosis
2. Necrosis

### Apoptosis
Due to persistent reversible injury -> Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- leakage of cytochrome C into cytoplasm
- This leads to Apoptosis
	- Pyknosis (ink-dot appearance) is seen

### Necrosis
- It's the spectrum of changes in the morphological appearance of tissue seen after cell death
- Due to reduced ATP supply, Calcium increases as pumps (in cell and within sarcoplasmic reticulum) fails 
- Increased calcium leads to 
		1. Mitochondrial densities -> Cell death
		2. Enzyme activation of intracellular enzymes
				- **Lysosomal enzymes**
				-  Phospholipase activation -> cell membrane damage due to breakage of phospholipids
				-  Nucleases
				-  Nucleic acid -> **leads to Pyknosis (ink dot like) Karyorrhexis (destructive fragmentation) and karyorrlysis** ![[Pasted image 20210618181638.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181244.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181250.png]]

> Normal pattern is a single band
 

 
 ## Cell Death
 
 #### Types of Necrosis

##### Coagulative necrosis
- Commonest pattern of necrosis seen microscopically
- Commonest reason is Ischemia
- Due to severe lactic acidosis resulting from lack of O2, denaturation/inactivation of hydrolytic enzymes occurs
This prevents hydrolysis
Thus the structural outline of the cell is preserved
> Hallmark
>- Tombstone appearance

- CNS ischemia is not associated with coagulative necrosis
- Commonly associated with neutrophilic infiltration - for clearing the dead cells

>Zenker's degeneration is a type of necrosis
>- Associated with Typhoid, it is the coagulative necrosis in the Skeletal Muscle

Infarct - **localized area** undergoing (coagulative) necrosis
- Usually wedge/triangular area
- Apex points towards area of ischemia
- Two types
	1. White - seen in (solid) organs with end arterial blood supply
	2. Red - seen in organs with (soft) loose connective tissue
		Seen in organs that have dual supply such as lungs, liver
		
##### Liquefactive necrosis
- A.k.a Colliquative necrosis
- Seen in focal bacterial infections and fungal infections
- Here ***activation of hydrolytic enzymes*** occurs - creamy yellow pus
	- CNS ischemia -> damage of glial cells leading to Hydrolytic enzyme present within getting activated
	- Also seen in infections (pus formation such as in Staph. aureus)
		- Microbes stimulate the accumulation of leukocytes and the liberation of enzymes from these cells.
	
##### Caseous necrosis
- Cheese-like necrosis
- Coagulative + Liquefactive necrosis
- Coagulative necrosis is predominant contributor. However cell structural outline is not preserved
	- Organisms associated with high lipid content
		- TB
		- Fungi
			- Histoplasmosis
			- Coccidiodomycosis/valley fever
		- Syphillis
- Granulomatous reaction - Monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration is seen rather than neutrophils
- **Langhans** Giant Cells are associated Tuberculosis and formed by fusion of macrophages (epitheloid cells) and surrounding cells
	- They are not the *same* as Lang***er***hans cells
	-  ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Granulation_tissue_containg_a_poorly_formed_granuloma_with_a_Langhan%27s_giant_cell.jpg/220px-Granulation_tissue_containg_a_poorly_formed_granuloma_with_a_Langhan%27s_giant_cell.jpg)

##### Fat necrosis
- Seen in organs containing high fat or lipase activation
	- Injury to breast tissue
	- Injury to omentum tissue
	- Pancreatitis
		- Acute pancreatitis is usually caused from gall stones or alcohol (both of them together cause 80% of pancreatitis)
		- Gall stones -> Lipase activation due to cholecystitis -> Lipids turn into fatty acids
- saponification: Fatty acids combine, fat converts to soap through lipase with calcium deposits
> Hallmark: Chalk-like yellow white deposit
When there's lower serum calcium, there's higher inflammation
![[Pasted image 20210619180910.png]]

##### Fibrinoid necrosis

- Antigen-antibody (immune complexes) are deposited in the endothelium along with fibrin
- Entry/leakage of plasma protein into the endothelium, forming deposits
	- Malignant hypertension
	- Pneuatic fever: Aschoff body
	- Type 3 hypersensitivity [Ppolyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)]
	- ![[Pasted image 20210619181936.png]]
	- Pinkish appearance inside of the vessel

#GANGRENE
Surgical term
- Dry Gangrene
	- Blood supply reduced (ischemia)
	- Usually coagulative necrosis
- Wet gangrene
	- Ischemia + Secondary infection
	- Usually liquifactive necrosis
		- Gas gangrene
			- Subtype of wet gangrene
			- Associated with Clostridium welchi

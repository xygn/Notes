# Introduction
>**H** - Hypoxic Hypoxia
**A** - Anemic Hypoxia
**S** - Stagnant Hypoxia
**H** - Hostotoxic Hypoxia

-  Low partial pressure of O2 in blood - **HYPOXEMIA** SaO2 is < 90 % PaO2 < 60mmHg |||| SaO2 - percentage of RBC bound to O2 ||| PaO2 - pressure of O2 inside arterioles

### Hypoxia

**Hypoxic hypoxia** - less O2 enters the blood stream due to
  
- less partial pressure of O2'
- Pulmonary pathology impairing diffusion
	• High altitudes   
	• ILD Interstitial Lung Disease)   	
	• Right  -> Left Shunt

#### Anemic hypoxia
Anemic Hypoxia - functional Hb is reduced in number
E.g:
- Altered Hb 
- CO poisonig -> CO-Hb **headache**, ***cherry red color*** present
- Met-Hb - ![[Pasted image 20210618184600.png]]
		- Associated with Cyt B5 reductase deficiency
		- Fe2 binds O2 -> Met-Hb has Fe3
		- **Chocolate colored blood** with cyanosis
		- Methemoglobemia is treated with **Methylene Blue IV** and vitamin C

- PaO2 and SaO2 is normal (as SaO2 is qualitative rather than quantitative) in quantiative anemias, while SaO2 is decreased in qualitative anemias


## Reversible injury
___
> Hallmark: Cellular swelling

e.g. Angina

**Mitochondria** is the first organelle that's affected from hypoxia, leading to decreased ATP.
	- Cell Membrane
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- Misc. Changes
	- Amorphous/mitochondrial density occurs due to calcium accumulation due to decreased ATP
	
// **Cell Membrane**:
- Na+K+ Pump reduced
	- Na+ increased
	- Water content inside increased as water follows
- Leads to Cellular Swelling (hydropic change) - 1st microscopic feature
	- Bleb formation
	- Microvilli formation
- Myelin figures | denatured phospholipid from cell membrane or membrane of organelles
	- Seen in ICM and ECM
	- Resembles of Myelin sheath surrounding neuron ![[Pasted image 20210618190851.png]]

// **Endoplasmic Reticulum**
Decreased ATP leads to
- Swelling of the RER
	- Ribosome breaks away (polyribosomes become monoribosomes)
	- Decreased protein synthesis
- Accumulation of misfolded proteins due to loss/impaired secondary and tertiary structures

// **Miscellaneous changes**
- Increased glycolysis (anaerobic pathway) leading to decreased glycogen
	- Increased accumulation of lactic acid and pyruvic acid leading of Acidosis
Nuclear changes:
- Chromatin clumping due to acidosis ![[Pasted image 20210618191049.png]]
- Liver becomes fatty

## Irreversible Cell Injury
_____

> Hallmark: Membrane damage of:
> 1. Plasma membrane
> 2. Inner mitochondrial membrane
> 3. Lysosome membrane

e.g: Myocardial Infarction
Two important patterns
1. Apoptosis
2. Necrosis

### Apoptosis
Due to persistent reversible injury -> Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- leakage of cytochrome C into cytoplasm
- This leads to Apoptosis

### Necrosis

- Due to reduced ATP supply, Calcium increases as pumps (in cell and within sarcoplasmic reticulum) fails 
- Increased calcium leads to 
		1. Mitochondrial densities -> Cell death
		2. Enzyme activation of intracellular enzymes
				- **Lysosomal enzymes**
				-  Phospholipase -> cell membrane damage due to
				-  Nucleases
				-  Nucleic acid -> **leads to Pyknosis (ink dot like) Karyorrhexis (destructive fragmentation) and karyorrlysis** ![[Pasted image 20210618181638.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181244.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181250.png]]

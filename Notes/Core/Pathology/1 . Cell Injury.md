# Introduction
>**H** - Hypoxic Hypoxia
**A** - Anemic Hypoxia
**S** - Stagnant Hypoxia
**H** - Hostotoxic Hypoxia

-  Low partial pressure of O2 in blood - **HYPOXEMIA** SaO2 is < 90 % PaO2 < 60mmHg |||| SaO2 - percentage of RBC bound to O2 ||| PaO2 - pressure of O2 inside arterioles

### Hypoxia

**Hypoxic hypoxia** - less O2 enters the blood stream due to
  
- less partial pressure of O2'
- Pulmonary pathology impairing diffusion
	• High altitudes   
	• ILD Interstitial Lung Disease)   	
	• Right  -> Left Shunt

#### Anemic hypoxia
Anemic Hypoxia - functional Hb is reduced in number
E.g:
- Altered Hb 
- CO poisonig -> CO-Hb **headache**, ***cherry red color*** present
- Met-Hb - ![[Pasted image 20210618184600.png]]
		- Associated with Cyt B5 reductase deficiency
		- Fe2 binds O2 -> Met-Hb has Fe3
		- **Chocolate colored blood** with cyanosis
		- Methemoglobemia is treated with **Methylene Blue IV** and vitamin C

- PaO2 and SaO2 is normal (as SaO2 is qualitative rather than quantitative) in quantiative anemias, while SaO2 is decreased in qualitative anemias


## Reversible injury
___
Hallmark: Cellular swelling
e.g. Angina

Mitochondria is the first organelle that's affected from hypoxia, leading to decreased ATP.
	- Cell Membrane
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- Misc. Changes
	- Amorphous/mitochondrial density
	It occurs due to calcium accumulation due to decreased ATP
	




## Irreversible Cell Injury

> Hallmark: Membrane damage of:
	1. Plasma membrane
	2. Mitochondrial membrane
	3. 

e.g: Myocardial Infarction
Two important patterns
1. Apoptosis
2. Necrosis

Due to persistent reversible injury -> Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- leakage of cytochrome C into cytoplasm
- This leads to Apoptosis

Necrosis
_____

- Due to reduced ATP supply, Calcium increases as pumps (in cell and within sarcoplasmic reticulum) fails 
- Increased calcium leads to 
		1. Mitochondrial densities -> Cell death
		2. Enzyme activation of intracellular enzymes
				- **Lysosomal enzymes**
				-  Phospholipase -> cell membrane damage due to
				-  Nucleases
				-  Nucleic acid -> **leads to Pyknosis (ink dot2 like) Karyorrhexis (destructive fragmentation) and karyorrlysis** ![[Pasted image 20210618181638.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181244.png]]![[Pasted image 20210618181250.png]]
-  Smeared pattern during cell necrosis compared to step-laddern (apoptosis).

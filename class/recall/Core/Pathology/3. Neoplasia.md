Ans. (c) Vascular invasion(Ref: Robbins 9/e p1094)

Robbins clearly write…. ‘Microscopically, most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles. Follicular carcinomas may be grossly infiltrative or minimally invasive. The latter are sharply demarcated lesions that may be impossible to distinguish from follicular adenomas on gross examination. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface, to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. Extensive invasion of adjacent thyroid parenchyma makes the diagnosis of carcinoma obvious in some cases’.

•Ideal answer for a question for diagnosis of follicular cancer is capsular invasionQ (better than even vascular invasion) but in the given options, vascular invasion is the answer of choice.

Fibromatosis are a group of fibroblastic proliferations. Though they are locally aggressive, they do not metastasize.

Small cell carcinoma of lung most commonly metastasize to the brain. It accounts for about 40% of brain metastases.

Other Tumors Metastasizing to Brain are carcinomas of • Breast, • Melanoma, • Kidney, • GIT

Certain non-neoplastic disorders—the chronic atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, solar keratosis of the skin, chronic ulcerative colitis, and leukoplakia of the oral cavity, vulva, and penis—have such a well-defined association with cancer that they have been termed precancerous conditions.

Immunity is divided into 
1. Innante
	- Non-specific
	- No memory (amnesic)
2. Adaptive
	- specific
	- Memory (a-amnesic)



# Innate Immunity
Innate immunity is the inborn resistance against infections that an individual possesses right from the birth, due to his genetic or constitutional makeup.

1. Barriers
	- Anatomical [skin]
	- Physiological [body temperature, pH, secretions and their contents]
		- Spermine in semen prevents gram-positive bacterial growth

:::

2. Proteins
	- C-reactive proteins
	- Lectin [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Lectin pathway]]
		- e.g: Mannose Binding Lectins [CD14 of macrophage recognizes]
	- **Complement proteins** [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Complement System]]
	- Surfactants and plasma proteins
	- **Cytokines**

3. Cells
	- **Neutrophils**
	- **Macrophages**
	- **NK Cells** [[#NK Cells]]
		 - Natural Killer (NK) Cells are lymphocytes in the **same family as T and B cells**, coming from a common progenitor. However, as cells of the innate immune system, NK cells are classified as group I Innate Lymphocytes (ILCs) and respond quickly to a wide variety of pathological challenges.
		 - They kill ==virus infected== cells
		 - Kills ==tumor cells==
	 - Several rare types of lymphocytes that share the features of **both acquired** and **innate immunity**
		
		![[Pasted image 20210710182536.png]]
	 - γδ T cells 
		 - Also called intraepithelial lymphocytes: They are present in epithelial lining of skin and mucosa
	 - NK-T cells: 
		 - They are present in epithelium and lymphoid organs
	 - B-1 cells:
		 -  They are found mostly in the peritoneal cavity and mucosal tissues
	- Marginal-zone B cells:
		-  They are present at the edges of lymphoid follicles of spleen.
	-  **Mast Cells**
		- They are present in the epithelial lining of the respiratory and other mucosa.
	- **Dendritic Cells**
		- They respond to microbes by producing numerous cytokines that initiate inflammation.
		- They also act as APCs - Antigen Presenting Cells [[#Professional APCs]]

4. Normal Resident Flora
	- Normal resident flora lining intestinal, respiratory and genital tract exert several antimicrobial activities.
		- They compete with the pathogens for nutrition
		- They produce antibacterial substances.

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Macrophages and Dendritic Cells    | Inflammatory                 | APCs                                                       |

| e.g:                               | IL-1 activates T-helper cell | IFN-gamma activation of macrophage -> epitheloid histocyte |

**How are pathogens recognized?**
## Pattern Recognition receptors
- Bacteria/microbes exhibit patterns of conserved molecules common to  most pathogens: 
	- Pathogen/Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns
		- *e.g: peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), teichoic acid and lipoproteins present on bacterial surface.*
- Inflammation
	- Damage Associated Molecular Patterns

Pattern Recognition Molecules present on surface of host cells (e.g. phagocytes) that recognize PAMPs/MAMPs.

**Types**:
1.  Toll-like receptor - ==main receptor for innate immunity==
	- Causes activation of 
		- NF-κB(Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell - a transcription factor)
			- Causes recruitment of leukocytes
			- Activates COX-2
		- IFN-1 (type 1)
			- Antiviral action
	- Signals generated following binding of TLRs to MAMPs activate transcription factors that stimulate expression of genes encoding cytokines and enzymes, which are involved in several antimicrobial activities of cells of innate immunity.

2.  C-type LR (Lectin Receptor)
	-	Important against fungal infections


### Cytosolic Receptors
1. RIG-like receptor
	- Act against viral nucleic acids
2. NOD-like receptor
	- Identifies:
		- Bacteria
		- K+ levels (eflux)
		- Uric Acid
		- ROS
	- Activates inflammasome
		- Which activates Caspase 1 -> IL1 -> Fever Inflammation
		[[class/Core/Pathology/General/1. Cell Injury#Pyroptosis]]
		

## NK-Cells
==**This is a component of Innate Immunity**==

Hematopoitic Stem Cells -> Lymphoid Stem Cells

- Lymphoid Stem Cells then differentiates
	- In Thymus gland: [[#T Cell]] T cell
	- In Bone Marrow: [[#B-cells]] B-Cell
	- Naive: Natural Killer Cells
		-  Innate Lymphoid Cells

**NK-Cells**
- They can secrete cytokines like T-cells
- They do **not** have TCR
- They were earlier known as Large Granular Lymphocytes [LGL]
- They kill ==virus infected== cells
- Kills ==tumor cells==

![[Pasted image 20210708230309.png|500]]

**Two important receptors**
1. Stimulatory/Activating receptor 
2. Inhibitory Receptor
	- All cells in the body have MHC Class I molecule
	- This stimulates the inhibitory receptor

- MHC class I has reduced expression in mutated cells (tumors) or viruses
[[class/Core/Pathology/General/3. Neoplasia#^c7c179]]
- Virus and cancer tumors have molecules that amplify molecules that activate the Activating receptor

**NK cells also have**
1. CD16
	- Also known as Fc receptor
	- Fc portion of the ImmunoglobulinG attaches to this [[#IgG]]
		- NK-cell destroys the coated antigenic cell
		- Antibody Dependent Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity [**CDCC**]
2. CD56



# Adaptive Immunity
Acquired/Adaptive immunity is defined as the resistance against the infecting foreign substance that an individual acquires or adapts during the course of his life.

- Specific
	- Developed through somatic recombination of gene segments
- Memory (a-amnesic)
	- A proportion of T and B cells become memory cells following primary contact of the microbe, which play an important role when the microbe is encountered subsequently
- Contributed by
	- T-cells - ==Cell-mediated==
		- Effective against intracellular microbes
	- B-Cells  - ==Humoral immunity==
		- Effective against extracellular microbes
- Response in days
- Usually requires prior exposure
- Diverse

## Active Immunity
- The host’s immune system is actively involved in response to the antigenic stimulus; 
	- leading to the production of immunologically active T cells, B cells and production of specific antibodies
- Two types:
	1. Natural Active Immunity
		- Develops from Natural exposure to microbial infection

	2. Artificial Active Immunity
		- Develops following exposure to immunogen by vaccination
- Active immunity ==often fails== to develop when the host is ==immunocompromised==
- It is usually **long lasting**
	- Long: ***chickenpox, measles, smallpox, mumps and rubella***
	- Short: ***following influenza virus infection***
	- **==Premunition==**:
		- Lasts as long as the microbe is present
		- Seen in ***Plasmodium and spirochetes infection***
:::{.note}
- Active immunity may not even be protective at all
- If infected by ***Haemophilus ducreyi***, the patient may develop genital lesions following reinfection even while the primary infection is active.
:::


### Responses

:::{.note}

![[Pasted image 20210710174938.png]]

:::

![[Pasted image 20210710174914.png]]

:::{.note}
#### Secondary Immune Response
- When a subsequent antigenic exposure occurs 
	1.  **Latent period is either absent** or of **short duration**. 
		-  This is because memory cells become active soon after the antigenic exposure
	2. There may be a negative phase during which the antibody level may become lower than it was before the antigenic stimulus. 
		- This is because the exposed antigen combines with the pre-existing antibody and thus the antibody level in serum falls down
	3. **Antibody surge**: Secondary antibody response is prompt, powerful, long-lasting and mainly of ==IgG== type. 
		- Hence, it is said that, the booster doses of vaccines are more effective than the first dose.
:::

#### Primary Immune Response
- Active immunity develops only after a **==latent period==** following the antigenic exposure, which corresponds to the time required for the host’s immune apparatus to become active
- Majority of activated T and B cells against the antigenic stimulus become ==effector T and B cells==
	- Effector B cells include plasma cells. [[#B-cells]]
	- Effector T-cells include Cytotoxic and Helper T cells
- **Minor proportion** of stimulated T and B cells ***==become memory cells==***, which are the key cells for secondary immune response
- Effector B cells produce antibodies (mainly IgM type). 
	- Antibodies appear in the serum in slow and sluggish manner; 
	- reach peak 
	- Maintain the level for a while and then fall down. Finally, a low titer of baseline antibodies may be maintained in the serum


## Passive Immunity

:::{.highlight-block}

![[Pasted image 20210710180403.png]]

:::

Passive immunity is defined as the resistance that is transferred passively to a host in a “readymade” form without active participation of the host’s immune system

- Again 2 types
	1. **Natural passive immunity**
		- Involves the IgG antibody transfer from mother to fetus across the placenta
	2. **Artificial passive immunity **
		- Develops following readymade transfer of commercially prepared immunoglobulin (e.g. Rabies immunoglobulin).
		- Another example is ==Adoptive Immunity==
			- e.g: Injection of immunologically competent T-lymphocytes known as transfer factor. It is useful for treatment when the CMI is low, e.g. in lepromatous leprosy.

> Important role in 
> - **Immunodeficient individuals** (as host’s immune apparatus is not effective) and;
> - **Post-exposure prophylaxis**; when an immediate effect is warranted

- It develops much faster relative to active
- **Amnesic** immunity

## B-cells
- Located in the 
	- Lymph node
	- Spleen
	- GIT
		- Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue ==MALT==
			- Present highly in the Peyer's patches of the Ileum
		- ==Enteric fever== is due to the ulceration of Peyer Patches and thus commonly it's in the ileum
	- Tonsils

- The lymph node has muliple zones
	- Cortex - **B Cells**
	- Paracortex - **T-cells**
	- Medulla **Macrophages**

![[Pasted image 20210707215520.png]]

### B-Cell markers


==CD stands for Cluster of Differentiation==

- CD 19 to 23 (1923) 
	- ==CD19== - Pan B Marker (present in all stages of B-cell development)
	- CD21 - Receptor for **EBV** (Epstein ***B***arr Virus)
- CD 40
	- CD40 ligand is expressed on the T-cells 
		- CD40L of T-cell and CD40
		- ***B-cell : T-cell interaction***
		- Important in production of high quality antibody formation
- CD80 **/** B7-1 CD86 **/** B7-2 
	- CD80/86 are known as the **B7** (B7-1 and B7-2 respectively)
		- These interact with **CD28** on the T-cell to produce ==co-stimulatory signal==

:::{.sticky-note}
B-cells on activation -> Plasma-cell
- Plasma cells secrete antibodies (immunoglobulins)
:::

## Immunoglobulins

![[Pasted image 20210707220953.png]]

Made up of:
1. Light Chains
	- λ (lambda)
	- κ (kappa)
> - Normal ratio : 3:1 to 3:2 κ:λ

2. Heavy Chains
	- α (alpha)
	- γ (gamma) 
	- δ (delta)
	- ε (epsilon)
	- μ (mu)

:::{.sticky-note}
- Isotype
	- Different classes of antibodies in the same person
- Allotype
	- Difference in antibody taken from two people
- Idiotype
	- Variable part of antibody is different in same person
:::

### Immunoglobulin Classes / Isotypes
- These are dependent upon the heavy Chains present

### IgG
- Presence of Gamma γ heavy chain
	- ==Maxiumum concentration==
	- Crosses **Placenta**
	- *Complement Activation* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^0c3b7d]]
	- ***Opsonization***

### IgA
- Presence of the Alpha heavy chain
	- Forms:
		1. Monomer in the *Serum*
		2. Dimer in the *Mucosa and Secretions* - joined by **J** joining chain
- ==**First Line of Defense**== (as majority of the infections have to pass through **mucosal** layer)
	- It activates the Alternate pathway *rarely* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Alternate Pathway]]

:::{.sticky-note}
Local or mucosal immunity is the immune response that is active at the mucosal surfaces such as intestinal or respiratory or genitourinary mucosa.
- It is mediated by a *type of IgA* antibody called **secretory IgA**, which prevents the entry of microbes at the local site itself
- Local immunity can only be induced by natural infection or by live vaccination (**but not by killed vaccines)**
	- Following administration of live **oral polio vaccine (OPV)**; 
	- Secretory IgA antibodies are synthesized and coated on intestinal mucosa which prevent subsequent poliovirus infections. Such immunity does not develop following injectable killed polio vaccine (IPV).
:::

### IgM
- Presence of mu heavy chain
- M for
	- Max Size
		- ==Pentameric==
	- Max Molecular Weight
- *Complement Pathway Activation* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^0c3b7d]]
	- Primary Immune Response - IgM is mostly produced than IgG (predominant)
- Monomeric form is present on B-Cell Receptor

### IgD
- Presence of Delta Heavy Chain
- Functions as acts as B-cell receptor

### IgE
- Presence of Epsilon Heavy Chain
- Lowest Concentration
- Attached to the surface of Mast Cells [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^a7504d]]
	- Responsible for Type-1 Hypersensitivity Reaction 
- Heat labile antibody


## Antigens

- Exogenous
- Endogenous
- Autogenous

| Types of Antigens based on B-Cell activation              |
| ------------------------------ |
| Non-Proteinaceous              |
| Proteinaceous/T-Cell Dependent |



#### Non-Proteinaceous Antigens
- These are free antigens that do not require any additional cells for activation
	- Thus also known as thymic-independent antigens/T-cell independent
	- **Pentameric** IgM antibodies are produced when bound to **monomeric** form of IgM present on BCR
- Leads to T-cell indepent activation of B-Cell

![[Pasted image 20210707224227.png]]

#### Proteinaceous Antigens

- Requires the support of T-CeLLS for proper activation of Immune System

![[Pasted image 20210707224246.png]]


- B-Cell or APCs (antigen presenting cells) expresses antigen on the surface 
- T-CR (T-cell receptor) then recognizes the antigen
- T-cell then attaches to the MHC class
- CD40(B-cell) and CD40L (T-Cell) interaction occurs
	- This leads to secretion of IL-4/IL-5
	- [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132|Cytokine Reference]]
	- This causes IgM -> IgG/A/E [isotype/class switching : change in heavy chain by IL-4/IL-5]
		- This is *reaaallyy* important for somatic hypermutation ^4e39b6
		- If this is cytokine secretion is blocked -> Hyper IgM syndrome


## T Cell

- Named from the fact that they develop in the thymus
- Present in the 
	- Lymph Node
		- Paracortex
		
		![[Pasted image 20210707215520.png]]
	- Spleen
		- Periarteiloar Lymphoid Sheath
			- PALS
	- GIT
		- Present within the intraepithelial lymphocytes [IELs] | compare this with B cells in the mucosal lymph node (MALTS)

**Structure**
- T-cell Receptor (TCR)
	- Binds to ***prebound*** antigens only
	- Prebound antigens are presented by APCs
- CD molecules
	- CD 1 to 5, 7 and 8 [CD1 CD2 CD3 CD4 CD5 CD7 CD8]
		- These are all T-cell markers
		- Pan-T-Cell Marker - ==CD3==
			- Significant in signal transduction mechanism
			- Activation of T-cell assisted by calcineurin and IL-2 [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132]]
	- CD28
		- Costimulatory signal from APCs such as B-cells
		- Binds to Ce
	- CD40-**L**
		- Attaches to B-Cell CD40 receptor
		- Important for T-Cell B-Cell 

T-Cells can be divided into:
1. CD4+ T Cells - Helper Cells
	- CD4 molecule is present
	- Subtypes
	
		| T Cell type | Reaction                                                   | Secretion of       |
		| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
		| Th1         | Type IV HR                                                 | IL2  and IFN gamma |
		| Th2         | Type I HR                                                  | IL-4 and IL-5      |
		| Th17        | Responsible for Fungal infections and autoimmune disorders | IL-17              |
		
[[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132]]

2. CD+ T-cells - **Cytotoxic**
	- CD8 positive
	- Binds to MHC Class I

# Activation of Immune System

- Antigens are divided into
1. Proteinaceous antigens
	- T-Cell dependent
2. Carbohydrate/Lipid Antigens (non-proteinaceous)
	- T-Cell independent


1. Antigen presenting cells internalize antigens and process it
2. APCs then express the antigenic peptide through the MHC molecule
3. MHC molecule is responsible for attachment of antigenic peptide
4. Then APCs enter the systemic circulation and lymphatic circulation
5. Clonal Selection occurs:
	- Only a few T-cells come in contact with specific antigen peptides presented by the APC depending upon the specific antigen

## T-cells:
1. **Effector T-cells**
	- Deals with the presentation
2. **Memory T-cells**
	- These remain dormant after developing antigen receptor
	- Deals with later infection
	- These are fewer in number
	- **CD45RO** is used to detect memory T-Cell
		- CD45 is present on leukocytes
		- Mem **==OR==** y - *Memory device*

## APCs:

- APCs internalize internal/external peptides (after being broken down)
- The MHC chains produced by the Endoplasmic Reticulum is expressed on the APC surface along with the peptide in

### Professional APCs
- These APCs have a very high expression of MHC [^MHC]
1. Dendritic Cells
	- Lang==er==hans cells (tissue resident macrophage) - **Skin and Interstitial Cell**
	- Follicular dendritic cells - ***reservoir for ==HIV==*** present in - **Lymph node and spleen**
2. B-Cells
	- Activated B-cells turn into plasma cells -> secrete antibodies
3. Macrophages


	![[Pasted image 20210701093452.png]]
	- ==CD13, CD14, CD15 and CD33== are CD markers


### Non-Professional APCs
- These are non-standard APCs with low but significant expression of MHC 
1. Fibroblasts
2. Endothelia Cells
3. Thymic epithelial cells
4. Glial Cells
5. Pancreatic Beta-Cells


## MHC 
Major Histocompaitibility Complex
Also known as HLA - Human Leukocyte Antigen

- The gene encoding is present on short arm of Chromosome 6p
![[Pasted image 20210710123112.png]]

1. Class I region codes for MHC I
	- MHC I is present in all **nucleated** cells and ==Platelets==
2. Class II region encodes for MHC II
	- MHC II is present in all **APCs**
3. Class III region codes for
	1. C2
	2. C4
	3. Properdin
	4. TNF-alpha
	5. 21-alpha  hydroxylase


- Cell Activated - immune cell activated
- Ag Binding Cleft


### MHC Class I

![[Pasted image 20210709200207.png | 400]]

- Made of 3 alpha chains and 1 beta chain 
- Antigenic cleft is present in between alpha 1 and alpha 2
- Alpha 1 and alpha 2 are distal alpha chains 
- Alpha 3 is proximal alpha chain

> Distal chains form the antigen binding cleft

 - CD8+ T-cells bind to MHC Class I - Endogenous Antigens

### MHC Class II

![[Pasted image 20210709200307.png | 400]]

- Made of two alpha and two beta
- Antigenic cleft is present in between Beta 1 and Alpha 1
- Beta 1 and Alpha 1 are distal chains 

:::{.note}
- MHC Class I is detected by ==Alloantiserum==
- MHC Class II is detected by ==Mixed Lymphpcyte Reaction==
:::

- CD4+ T-cells bind to MHC Class II - Exogenous Antigens
- Most antigens bind to MHC class II


## Clinical Relevance Of MHC

1. **Genetic Association of Disease**
	-	**HLA - DR3/DR4** of class II region is associated with **==Type 1 Diabetes Melitus==** [^type1]
	-	**HLA - B27** of Class I region is associated with Ankylosing spondytis [^AnkSpo]
2. **Organ Transplantation**
	- Gene match of HLA is done to ensure compaitibility
	- Tissue typing is done by:
		- Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (the same test for MHC II)
		- Micro-cytotoxicity assay
		- Nowadays HLA molecular matching is done
3. **Paternity Disputes**

## T-Cell Activation
- There are 2 signals involved
	1. Primary Signal/Signal 1
		- MHC II binding to CD4 receptor
	2. Co-stimulatory signal
		- CD28 on T cell with B7 
			- B7a - CD80
			- B7b - CD86
	- Both signals are required for ==T-cell activation==
		- External antigen provides both signals
		- **Self antigens however** only provide primary signal
			- Co-stimulatory signal is not generated - ==**ANERGY**==
			- This property is known as: Tolerance is exhibited by Self-antigens
	- ==Negative== co-stimulatory signal may also be received
		- Negative co-stimulatory signal delivery molecules - usually present in self-antigens
		- It reduces T-cell activation
			- CDLA-4
			- PD-1
		- **B7.1 and B7.2** interact with this
		- This is another exhibition of Tolerance


[^MHC]: Major Histocompaitibility Complex
[^type1]: Pancreas produces little to no insulin
[^AnkSpo]: A type of arthritis in which there is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine. Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time.

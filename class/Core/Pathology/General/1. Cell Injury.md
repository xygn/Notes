# Introduction

## Cellular Adaptations
### Atrophy
   **n** -> n
-   **Physiologic**:  
    Uterus after parturition  
    Organ atrophy (fetal development)
-   **Pathologic**:  
    Disuse  
    Denervation e.g. : Polio  
    Inadequate nutrition e.g.: PEM  
    Chronic Ischemic Atrophy e.g.: Senile dementia (Alzheimer's)

Atrophy is now considered **Pre-malignant** instead of Benign


> ![[Pasted image 20210627214134.png]]

### Hypertrophy
n -> N
- Increased cellular protein production
- Mechanical sensors (integrins?) or Agonists or Growth factors -> Signal Transduction pathways -> Transcription factors -> Increased cellular protein synthesis
-   Physiologic  
    Uterine hypertrophy during pregnancy  
    Skeltal muscles
-   Pathologic:  
    Cardiac hypertrophy (in hypertension/valvular disease) - left ventricle most affected

### Hyperplasia 
n -> 10n
-   Physiologic:  
    Uterus and breast (during puberty and pregnancy  
    Bone Marrow (hemolytic anemia)
-   Pathologic  
    Prostatic Hyperplasia (due to increased secretion of Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) -> Increased prostate cells \-> Periurethral zone enlarges as prostate size increases-> Urethra compression BENIGN
-   Endometrial Hyperplasia

When uncontrolled hyperplasia occurs it may progress to cancer, thus endometrial hyperplasia is pre-malignant as uncontrolled irregular hyperplasia will lead to malignancies.

### Metaplasia 
n -> h
-   Epithelial Metaplasia  
    e.g: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar Epithelium to squamous in the lungs (due to smoking) (Squamous metaplasia) --------------------------------------> Squamous cancer
- Vitamin A deficiency can also result in metaplasia. It is necessary for differentiation of specialized epithelial surfaces such as the conjunctiva covering the eye.
	- In vitamin A deficiency, the thin squamous lining ofthe conjunctiva undergoes metaplasia into stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium. This change is called keratomalacia 

	![[Pasted image 20210624103225.png]]
-   Acid reflux causes squamous to columnar epithelia (intestinal columnar metaplasia  
    Barret's esophagus - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Goblet cells are present secretes mucin identified by Alcian blue stain \[Goblet cells appear blue in color\]
-   Connective Tissue Metaplasia  
    Myositis Ossificans  
    Hemorhhage/traumatic injury in muscle -> stemcells differentiate into other mesenchymal cells -> muscle replaced like bone-like tissue
	
	
>**H** - Hypoxic Hypoxia
**A** - Anemic Hypoxia
**S** - Stagnant Hypoxia
**H** - Histotoxic Hypoxia

-  Low partial pressure of O2 in blood - **HYPOXEMIA** SaO2 is < 90 % PaO2 < 60mmHg |||| SaO2 - percentage of RBC bound to O2 ||| PaO2 - pressure of O2 inside arterioles
 
 ![[Pasted image 20210618183900.png | 250]]

## Hypoxia
### Hypoxic hypoxia
**Hypoxic hypoxia** - less O2 enters the blood stream due to
  
- less partial pressure of O2'
- Pulmonary pathology impairing diffusion
	• High altitudes   
	• ILD Interstitial Lung Disease)   	
	• Right  -> Left Shunt

### Anemic hypoxia
Anemic Hypoxia - functional Hb is reduced in number
E.g:
- Altered Hb 
- CO poisonig -> CO-Hb **headache**, ***cherry red color*** present
- Met-Hb - 
		- 
		![[Pasted image 20210618184600.png]]
		- Associated with Cyt B5 reductase deficiency
		- Fe2 binds O2 -> Met-Hb has Fe3
		- **Chocolate colored blood** with cyanosis
		- Methemoglobemia is treated with **Methylene Blue IV** and vitamin C

- PaO2 and SaO2 is normal (as SaO2 is qualitative rather than quantitative) in quantiative anemias, while SaO2 is decreased in qualitative anemias
   

### Stagnant Hypoxia  
  
Ischemia - arterial obstruction - most common reason for development of hypoxia
					Congestion - venous obstruction
   
### Histotoxic hypoxia  
 -   Cell or a tissue is exposed to toxins leading to inability to use O2  
    e.g,  
	- Cytochrome inhibited by cyanide (associated with IV Nitroprusside long duration - usually given by microdrip set  
    - Cyanide posioning - **brick red**
    Rx -  
	- Vit B12 [methylcobalamine] converts into cyanocobaiamine which is water soluble, excerted by kidneys
	- Amyl nitrate
	- Sodium Thiosufate

## Reversible injury
___
> Hallmark: Cellular swelling

Injury:
- Onset - CNS 2 minutes > Cardiac Fiber 20-30 minutes > Skeletal Muscle fiber > Fibroblast
In the CNS, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum is most susceptible  
Cerebral cortical neurons 3,5,6 layers  
In the cardiac tissue -  Sub endocardial area in the most sensitive area  
GIT - Splenic flexure and rectosigmoid colon
There is a time lag between stress and onset of morphologic changes

e.g. Angina is reversible injury

**Mitochondria** is the first organelle that's affected from hypoxia, leading to decreased ATP.
	- Cell Membrane
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- Misc. Changes
	- Amorphous/mitochondrial density occurs due to calcium accumulation due to decreased ATP
	
// **Cell Membrane**:
- Na+K+ Pump reduced
	- Na+ increased
	- Water content inside increased as water follows
- Leads to Cellular Swelling (hydropic change) - 1st microscopic feature
	- Bleb formation
	- Microvilli formation
- Myelin figures | denatured phospholipid from cell membrane or membrane of organelles
	- Seen in ICM and ECM
	- Resembles of Myelin sheath surrounding neuron 

![[Pasted image 20210618190851.png]]

// **Endoplasmic Reticulum**
Decreased ATP leads to
- Swelling of the RER
	- Ribosome breaks away (polyribosomes become monoribosomes)
	- Decreased protein synthesis
- Accumulation of misfolded proteins due to loss/impaired secondary and tertiary structures

> Accumulation of misfolded proteins leads the ER to produce an *Unfolderd Protein Response* activating 
>  1. Increased chaperone production 
>  2. Decreased protein translation
>  3. Proteosomal degradation of misfolded proteins
>  This leads to reduction in misfolded proteins. If ER is unable to cope with this -> ER stress which leads to activation of caspase -> Apoptosis

// **Miscellaneous changes**
- Increased glycolysis (anaerobic pathway) leading to decreased glycogen
	- Increased accumulation of lactic acid and pyruvic acid leading of Acidosis
Nuclear changes:
- Chromatin clumping due to acidosis 

![[Pasted image 20210618191049.png]]
- Liver becomes fatty

## Irreversible Cell Injury
_____

> Hallmark: Membrane damage of:
> 1. Plasma membrane
> 2. Inner mitochondrial membrane
> 3. Lysosome membrane
> - **Loss of nucleus**

e.g: Myocardial Infarction
Two important patterns
1. Apoptosis
2. Necrosis

   

### Apoptosis
Due to persistent reversible injury -> Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- leakage of cytochrome C into cytoplasm
- This leads to Apoptosis
	- Pyknosis (ink-dot appearance) is seen

Apoptosis - Falling of leaves
- **Caspase **dependent Programmed Cell death
- Controlled cell death - by genes
- May affect single or multiple cells

#### Types of genes
- Anti-apoptotic - Contain 4 domains (BH1-4)
	1. BCL-2 [Associated with follicular lymphoma] ^565948
	2. BCL-XL
	3. MCL-1 gene [Associated with development of resistance to chemotherapy]
	- Sex steroids [Drug that inhibits apoptosis]
	> L - genes - Anti-apoptotic except Xs

- Pro apoptoptic - Contains 3 domains (BH1-3)
	1. BAK
	2. BAX
	3. BCL-Xs
	4. P53
	-  Glucocorticoids [Drug that promotes apoptosis]

- Regulated (by Sensors) apoptosis initiators - Contains BH-3 domain (1 domain only)
	- When upregulated and activate they can initiate apoptosis, by directly activating the two critical pro-apoptotic family members, BAX and BAK
	- BH3-only proteins may also bind to and block the function of BCL2 and BCL-XL
	1. BAD
	2. BiM
	3. BiD
	4. PUMA
	5. NOXA

#### Types of Apoptosis
- **Physiological**
	- Embryogenesis
		- removal of tail cells in developing fetus
		- separation of finger due to death of cells present between fingers [Syndactemy - presence of webbed fingers due to non-apoptosis]
		- Menstrual cycle - endometrial shedding
		- Post-Infection -> Leukocytes are killed off
		- Self-reactive B and T cells (lymphocytes) are resigned through Apoptosis
 - **Pathological**
	- DNA damage such as exposure to DNA damage
	- Duct obstruction ( in kidneys, salivary glands, pancreas etc)
	-  Viral infection (such as of hepatocytes) | CD8+ T-cell mediated killing
		-  **Councilmann** bodies (Apoptitic bodies) are an indication of apoptosis #hepatitis
	-  Transplant rejection / *Graft vs Host disease*
	-  Retinitis pigemontosa
		-  *Excessive apoptosis of Rod pigmentation* [causes Night Blindness]
		-  (rods -> dim vision | cones -> daylight vision/color vision)
		
#### Process
- Normal mitochondria has Cyt-C
- BCL-2 inhibits movement of Cyt-C by keeping outer mitochondrial membrane impermeable
- BCL-2 recieves signals from growth factors
- Whenever there's a deficiency of growth factor (cellular injury, DNA damage, decreased hormonal stimulation, expression of BCL-2 decreases
- At the same time, BAK/BAX is expressed  -> Increases permeability of Mitochondria 
- This causes Cyt-C leaks into cytoplasm

 | Apoptosis                     | Necrosis            |
 | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
 | Affects single/small group    | Affects large group |
 | Physiological or pathological | Always pathological |


##### Pathways
###### Intrinsic Pathway
 - Leakage of Cytochrome C causes activation of APAF-1 (Apoptosis Protease Activating Factor-1) [Cyt-C + APAF-1 = Apoptosome]
 - This leads to activation of Caspases [Cysteine containing protease enzymes - Attacking Aspartic Acid residues | C-Asp-Ase]
	- Initiator caspase: Caspase-9 
	- Executioner caspases- Caspase-3/6/7 
> **In**tiator - N**in**e
- Executioner caspases activate
	1. Proteases - breaks down cytoskeleton
	2. Endonucleases - breaks down DNA

###### Extrinsic Pathway
Receptor-ligand pathway (e.g. seen in T-Cell Selection)
Receptors:
	- Type 1 TNF-R (TNFR1)
	- FAS-R a.k.a CD95
- On cell injury, ligands for the above receptors are released. FasL is expressed on T cells that recognize self antigens and on some CTLs that kill virus-infected and tumor cells.
- Whenever TNF-alpha or FAS-L/Cd95-L attaches to the receptor, the receptor trimerizes
- This activates is FADD [Fas Associated Death Domain]
- This converts Pro-Caspase 8 -> Caspase 8 (in humans, it's caspase 10 || Homo sapien - 10 letters)
> **Ei**ght - Extrinisic initiator
- This leads to activation of Executioner Pathways
- Extrinsic apoptosis pathway can be inhibited by a protein called FLIP, which binds to procaspase-8
- Executioner caspases activate
	1. Proteases
	2. Endonucleases

![[Pasted image 20210620134806.png]]

>**Sailent features**
>- Cell size - **Shrinkage** *vs* Necrosis had swelling | **Earliest feature**
>- No inflammation occurs | As the cell membrane remains intact
>//***HALLMARK FEATURE***
>- Due to activation of endonucleases, Chromatin fragmentation occurs -> **Chromatin condensation** //***HALLMARK FEATURE***
>- On gel electrophoresis - Step-ladder appearance 
>
>![[Pasted image 20210618181443.png | 100]]
>
>- Tunel technique [TdT terminaldeoxy nucleotide transferase - UTP - Nick End Labelling]
>				 -  This is a diagnostic 
>	- DUTP dye is a dye that attaches to 3'-OH of DNA
>	- Since there's multiple fragments, higher intensifed **brown** color
>-  Staining: Annexin V is used
> - Apoptotic cells have flipped molecules (such as **phosphatidylserine**) that are normally present within the cell membrane
>  - These flipped molecules attract phagocytic cells immediately
>  - Thus there is no enzyme leakage as there's no time for it. -> Cell membrane are intact
>   - Annexin V attaches to the flipped molecules
>  ** Molecules that flip are**
		> -  Phospitidyl serine - Attaches to ANNEXIN V
		>  - C1q
		>   - Thrombospondin

AIF - Apoptosis Initiating Factor is secreted in traumatic neuronal injury *instead of APAF - Apoptosis Activating Factor*

	 These do not inititate Caspases
	 They directly activate Endonucleases and Proteases
- *Di-amibino-phenyl-indole (DAPI) - useful for detection of apoptosis	 | Another is DUTP - tunnel technique*

- There may be interconnections between EP and IP, for instance, in hepatocytes and pancreatic β cells, caspase-8 produced by Fas signaling cleaves and activates the BH3-only protein BID, which then feeds into the mitochondrial pathway
###### Cytotoxic CD8+ T-Cell Pathway
- CD8+ recognizes antigens on MHC class 1 and then kill them
- C8+ T cell secretes perforins in membrane of target cell and create pores
- Granzyme enters pores and activates caspases

#### Clinical
**Excessive apoptosis**
- Neurodegenerative disorders
- Viral infections
**Reduced Apoptosis**
- Autoimmune disorders
 
 
 p53 -> activates when there's DNA damage
 - causes cell death in mutated DNA cells
 - located on chromosme 17 (Executioner - **3 + 6 + 7** + 1)
- 50% of human cancer are due to p53 mutation 
 
![[Pasted image 20210620140207.png]]

### Necrosis
- It's the spectrum of changes in the morphological appearance of tissue seen after cell death
- Local **acute** inflammation is induced to clear the damaged cells
- Due to reduced ATP supply, Calcium increases as pumps (in cell and within sarcoplasmic reticulum) fails as intracellular stores open up and also an influx through concentration gradient.
- Increased **calcium** leads to 
		1. Mitochondrial swelling with amorphous densities in the matrix. This is due to transient pore formation -> Cell death
		2. Enzyme activation of intracellular enzymes
				- **Lysosomal enzymes**
				-  Phospholipase activation -> cell membrane damage due to breakage of phospholipids
				-  ATPase -> reduced ATP
				-  Proteases -> Cell Damage
				-  Endonucleases
				-  Nucleic acid -> **leads to Pyknosis (ink dot like) Karyorrhexis (destructive fragmentation) and karyorrlysis**

>
>![[Pasted image 20210618181443.png | 100]]
> Normal pattern is a single band
- Abundant myelin figures, eosinophilia, pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyorrlysis - Main features

 
 #### Types of Necrosis

##### Coagulative necrosis
- Commonest pattern of necrosis seen microscopically
- Commonest reason is Ischemia
- Due to severe lactic acidosis resulting from lack of O2, denaturation/inactivation of hydrolytic enzymes occurs
This prevents hydrolysis and coagulation of cellular proteins occurs
Thus the structural outline of the cell is preserved
> Hallmark
>- Tombstone appearance

- CNS ischemia is not associated with coagulative necrosis
- Commonly associated with neutrophilic infiltration - for clearing the dead cells

>Zenker's degeneration is a type of necrosis
>- Associated with Typhoid, it is the coagulative necrosis in the Skeletal Muscle

Infarct - **localized area** undergoing (coagulative) necrosis
- Usually wedge/triangular area and pale in color usually
- Apex points towards area of ischemia
- Two types
	1. White - seen in (solid) organs with **end arterial blood supply**
	2. Red - seen in organs with (soft) loose connective tissue
		Seen in organs that have dual supply such as lungs, liver
		Usually because of venous drain blockage (testicular torsion) 
		
##### Liquefactive necrosis
- A.k.a Colliquative necrosis
- Seen in focal bacterial infections and fungal infections
- Here ***activation of hydrolytic enzymes*** occurs - creamy yellow pus
	- CNS ischemia -> damage of microglial cells leading to Hydrolytic enzyme present within getting activated
	- Abscess -> Walled off area of dead tissue -> Hydrolytic enzymes present in neutrophils liquefact it
	- Pancreatitis - enzymes in pancreas are blocked from flowing into duct, thus pancreatic liquefaction occurs
	- Also seen in infections (pus formation such as in Staph. aureus)
		- Microbes stimulate the accumulation of leukocytes and the liberation of enzymes from these cells.

			![[Pasted image 20210619183950.png | 500]]


	
##### Caseous necrosis
- Cottage-Cheese-like necrosis
- Coagulative + Liquefactive necrosis
- Coagulative necrosis is predominant contributor. However cell structural outline is not preserved
	- Organisms associated with high lipid content
		- Coci of tuberculous infection -> **Ghon's complex** is a lesion seen in the lung that is caused by tuberculosis
		- Fungi
			- Histoplasmosis
			- Coccidiodomycosis/valley fever
		- Syphillis
- Granulomatous reaction - Monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration is seen rather than neutrophils
- Granuloma - a structureless *collection of fragmented or lysed cells* and *amorphous **(no definite shape)** granular debris* enclosed **within a distinctive inflammatory border**.
- **Langhans** Giant Cells are associated Tuberculosis and formed by fusion of macrophages (epitheloid cells) and surrounding cells
	- They are not the *same* as Lang***er***hans cells
 
 ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Granulation_tissue_containg_a_poorly_formed_granuloma_with_a_Langhan%27s_giant_cell.jpg/220px-Granulation_tissue_containg_a_poorly_formed_granuloma_with_a_Langhan%27s_giant_cell.jpg)

##### Fat necrosis
- Seen in organs containing high fat or lipase activation
	- Injury to breast tissue
	- Injury to omentum tissue
	- Pancreatitis-mediated damage of pancreatic fat
		- Acute pancreatitis is usually caused from gall stones or alcohol (both of them together cause 80% of pancreatitis)
		- Gall stones -> Lipase activation due to cholecystitis -> Lipids turn into fatty acids
- saponification: Fatty acids combine, fat converts to soap through lipase with calcium deposits | DYSTROPHIC
> Hallmark: Chalk-like yellow white deposit
When there's lower serum calcium, there's higher inflammation
>
>![[Pasted image 20210619180910.png]]
>
> If cellular debris is not promptly destroyed, they provide a nidus for deposiition of calcium salts and other minerals.
This phenomenon is dystrophic #calcification

##### Fibrinoid necrosis

- Antigen-antibody (immune complexes) are deposited in the endothelium along with fibrin
- Entry/leakage of plasma protein into the endothelium, forming deposits
- Together these deposits result in bright pink and amorphous appearance (fibrinoid/fibrin-like)
	- Malignant hypertension
	- Pneuatic fever: Aschoff body
	- Preeclempsia - fibrinoid necrosis of placenta as a consequence of Preeclempsia
	- Vasculitis syndrome
	- Type 3 hypersensitivity [Ppolyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)]
	
	![[Pasted image 20210619181936.png]]
	- Pinkish appearance inside of the vessel

#GANGRENE
Surgical term
- Dry Gangrene (mummified)
	- Blood supply reduced (ischemia)
	- Usually coagulative necrosis
- Wet gangrene
	- Ischemia + Secondary infection
	- Usually liquifactive necrosis superimposed over coagulative
		- Gas gangrene
			- Subtype of wet gangrene
			- Associated with Clostridium welchi



### Pyroptosis
- Infections -> Intracellular/cytoplasmic receptors  (Nod Like receptors) attach to the infective agent
- Forms Inflammasome which activate Caspase **1** or Caspase **11**
	- Caspase 1 -> cleaves precursor of Interleukin-1 (IL-1)  -> Pyrexia/Fever
	- Caspase 11 -> Causes Cell death
- Autoinflammatory syndrome - There's overactivity of NLRs -> Periodic fever syndrome
	- Treated by IL-1 Antagonists

Morphological features
- Cellular swelling (**unlike Apoptosis**)
- Damage of plasma membrane -> thus Inflammation is present

### Necroptosis
- A.k.a Programmed necrosis
- Caspase **independent** Cell death
- TNF attaches to TNF-R1
- This leads to activation of Receptor associated kinase (RIPK1 and RIPK3)
- Leads to 
	- Formation of Reactive oxygen species
	- Decreased ATP
	- No activation of **caspase**
	- Cell membrane damage occurs
		- RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL (a cytoplasmic protein) -> MLKL translocates to Plasma membrane -> Membrane disruption

Physiological
- During formation of Mammalian bone growth plate

Pathological
- Pancreatitis
- Steatohepatitis
- Ischemia-Repurfusion injury
- Neurodegenrative disorders Parkinsonism

- CMV (_Cytomegalovirus_) produces FLIP which inhibits Caspase-8
	- Thus necroptosis is done 

### Ferroptosis
- Triggered when excessive intracellular levels of iron or reactive oxygen species overwhelm the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses to cause unchecked membrane lipid peroxidation
- The overall effect is the loss of plasma membrane permeability

## Free Radical Injury
- Free radicals molecule having single unpaired electron in an outer orbit
- Highly reactive molecule
- Can be generated physiologically/pathologically

### Causes
- **Physiologically**: During Oxidative Phosphorylation - during partial reduction of O2 leads to formation of superoxide
**Pathologically**
- Radiation exposure
- Reperfusion injury
	- When reperfusion occurs, inflammatory cells also reaches the dying tissue along with oxygen which leads to generation of free radicals 
- Heavy metal injury such as Copper and Iron (Cu and Fe)
	- As they exist in dual state oxidative state
	- Fe excessive - **hemochromatosis** - tissue damage
	- Cu - **Wilson's disease** - tissue damage
- Infections
	- Oxidative Stress from inability to detoxify - overwhelming attack on detoxifying enzymes
	- Inflammation: Oxidative Stress - Oxygen-dependent HOCl generation - usually generated by NADPH oxidase/Xanthine oxidase
- Chemicals and drugs
	- CCL4 -> CCL3**·** [Carbon tetrachloride is used in dry cleaning industry - damages the liver in the P450 sites -> Apolipoprotein syntheis is **impaired** thus there is ***fatty liver***]
	- Paracetamol -> Liver necrosis due to free radical generation
	- Nitric oxide

O2 -> O2·- (Superoxide) -> H2O2 -> OH· (hydroxy radical)
- Causes damage to DNA/Proteins/Lipids
- Lipids undergo peroxidation results in generating of more free radicals
- Thus free radical injury is an auto-catalytic reaction
- Fenton's reaction:

![[Pasted image 20210622133355.png]]
Generates hydroxy radical
	- Fe3+ is more in intracellular thus the produced Fe3+ is then reduced by a superoxide (O2·)
- Most dangerous: hydroxyl radical

### Elimination
- Anti-oxidants such as:
	- Vitamins:
		- Vitamin A, **C**, E
	- Plasma proteins:
		- Transferrin/lactoferrin (with Fe) 
		- Ceruloplasmin (with Cu)
	- Enzymes:

		![[Pasted image 20210622133653.png]]
		- Super Oxide Dismutase
			1. When present in the mitochondri Mg is a co-factor
			2. When present in the cytoplasm, Cu and Zn is a co-factor
				- Mutation in SOD1 leads to ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)
		- Catalase
		-  Glutathione Peroxidase catalyzes this reaction:

		![[Pasted image 20210622133902.png]]
		GS-SG:GSH ratio is thus higher if there's oxidative stress			
		
		
### Pathologic effects
1. Lipid peroxidation in membranes -> Interactions with lipids lead to formation of peroxides which are again reactive. Thus it is an autocatalytic chain *propagation* reaction.
2. Oxidative modification of proteins -> Breakdown/misfolding
3. DNA damage - Lesion in DNA -> Mutations

## Pigmentation
### Endogenous
#### Melanin
- Black pigment -> endogenous
- Provides hair and skin color
- Derived from tyrosine
- Identified by Masson-Fontana stain [Not specific] 

![[Pasted image 20210623161412.png]]
- More specific: Dopa-oxidase method
 

### Exogenous

- Most common: Coal dust
	- Asymptomatic mostly - causes Anthracosis
	- Progressive massive pigmentation
- Tattooing

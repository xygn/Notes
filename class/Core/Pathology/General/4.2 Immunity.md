# Hypersensitivity Reaction

- The immune system inititates collateral damage 

**Gel Coombs Classification:**

## Type I Hypersensitivity Reaction

### 1. Sensitization

1. Antigen is internalized by APC
2. Antigen is presented to the Th2 T-cell (CD4+)
3. T-Cell Activation occurs
4. Production of cytokines:
	- **IL-4** - Secretion of IgE and B-cell activation
	- **IL-5** - Recruitment of Eosinophils
	- **IL-13** - Mucus secretion

- The produced IgE attaches to mast cell IgE cross-link receptor modifying it
	- ==No symptoms== in this phase

### 2. Re-exposure

- Upon antigen re-entry, the IgE attches to the antigen which then cross-links with Mast cells that were modified
- This causes degranulation and release of chemicals
	1. **Acute/Pre-formed/Early Phase**
		- These chemicals are pre-formed and are released immediately
		- They include chemicals such as 
			- ***Histamines***
			- ***Protease***
			- **Eosinophil Chemotactic Factor**
	2. **Late phase**
		- **AA-metabolites**
			- LT4s - causes bronchospasm
			- PG2s - esp. PGB<sub>2</sub>
		- **Cytokines** 
			- TNF-alpha
			- IL-1
			- IL-4
			- IL-5
			- IL-13

## Type II Hypersensitivity Reaction
 
Also known as **Ab mediated HSR/Cytocytic HSR**

| Type 1              | Type 2                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| IgE played the role | IgG or IgM plays the role                  |
|                     | Presence of antigens on surface of tissues |
|                     |                                            |

**Mechanisms**
### Opsonization

![[Pasted image 20210716012037.png]]

Examples:
- Mismatch b Blood Transfusion Reaction
- Erythroblastosis Fetalis
- ***Autoimmune hemolytic anemia***
- ***Autoimmune thrombocytopenia***
- ***Autoimmune leucopenia***

### Inflammation

- The antigen-antibody complex activates complement system C3a/C5a
- Neutrophili/macrophages chemotoxis
- Leads to ==Tissue damage==
- ***Examples***
	- **Acute Rheumatic Fever**
		- The antigen of bacteria (strep.) is similar to cardiac tissue and joints
		- the antibodies produced against these antigens attack this
	- **ANCA-mediated Vasculitis**
		- ANCA - Anti-neutrophilic Cytoplasmic Antibodies
	- Goodpasture syndrome
		- Goodpasture syndrome also referred to as anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, is an **autoimmune disease** that affects both the kidneys and lungs by the formation of autoantibodies that attack their basement membranes
		- The non-helical protruding part of non-collagenous chain is the antigen against which antibodies are formed
		- Good- Glomerular
		- Pasture- Pulmonary
	- **Pemphigus vulgaris**
		- Epidermal cells are attaked
		- Presents as bullaes
	- Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid


### Cellular Dysfunction

- The presence of antibodies lead to Cellular Dysfunction
- This was also know as ==Type V== hypersensitivity reaction
- An antibody stimulates a receptor
	- e.g **Graves Disease** [^GravesDisease]
		- Leading cause for hyperthyroidism
	- **Myasthenia Gravis** [^MG]
		- Antibody against ==Acetyl choline==
	- **Pernicious anemia**
		- Intrinisic factor due to abnormal antibodies
	- **Insulin resistant** Diabetes melitus
		- Antibodies againt insulin receptor

## Type III Hypersensitivity

-  Also known as **Immune Complex Disease**


**Phase I**: Formation of antigen-antibody complexes
- Takes about ==5-7 days==
- Antigen entry -> Antibody formation -> Antigen-antibody binding

**Phase II** : Deposition of immune complexes
- [Immune complexes](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/ek0x5T#Z0aff747d9f89fdeec50df1ff21c79737) are deposited in tissue, especially blood vessels → initiation of [complement cascade](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1K022S#Z4e039511154b5fb4a8ed8e333cff7f04) → release of [lysosomal](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Lo0wcS#Z62243fdb434fa6a2028d74238955fc58) enzymes from [neutrophils](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/ln0vtg#Zd36074c54a3f63afa3afea2a3d7d26db) → [cell death](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/VP0GdT#Zb3483fa4a700b90a3cd8ccb27fb6b899) → [inflammation](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/j50_Pg#Za5de83449ff6a749e6c1348b93b1f3b1) → [vasculitis](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/fT0kJ2#Z65c5d02013e50d4a2715ee8ae8d47b02)
- Deposition occurs in ultafiltration organs et. cetera
- e.g: 
	- **Kidney** - glomerulonephritis
	- **Serosa**
	- **Lymph Nodes** - such as lymphadenopathy
	- **Skin**
	- **Synovium**

- ==10-14 days== lag time
- Thus it's also known as **Delayed Type Hypersensitivity**
- Immune-complexes that are ***medium*** sized are the most dangerous 
	- small ones are non-pathogenic
	- large ones result in acute manifestations with lagsss

| P        | Post. streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Polyarteritis Nodosa |

In **Acute SLE**: 
- ==Serum C3== levels is reduced due to excessive activation of complement cascade indicative of **active** disease

ARTHUS: This reaction is usually encountered in ==experimental settings== following the injection of antigens (in **vaccines**)

:::


## Hypersensitivity IV Reaction

- This is **==CELL MEDIATED==** hypersensitivity and not antibodies 
- **CD4+ T-cell involvement**
	- Leads to **Delayed Type Hypersensitivity**
	- Antigen presents to APC 
	- Activates Th1 or Th17
		- When IFN-gamma is secreted -> IFN-gamma -> Th1 cell
		- When IL-1, IL-6, IL-23 is secreted -> Th17 activation -> ==**Memory cell**==
		- On **re-exposure**:
			- Th1 cell production increases
			- Lymphoctoxin increases
			- Macrophage activation
			- **Formation of Granuloma**
		-  Primary Th1 activation -> more macrophages are seen in granuloma
		-  Primary Th17 activation -> more neutrophilic infiltration

> **Tuberculin test/Mantoux test**
> - 0.1ml purified protein derivative of mycobacterium microbe is given into forearm intradermal
> - in non-exposed individuals, it leads to formation of antibodies
> - however in exposed indivduals, it is re-exposure, thus forming **granulomas** and **swelling**
> - Thus after 72 hours, measurement of the induration
> - It is a check of if the person has been exposed to mycobacteria AND if immune system is working
> **Lepromin test**
> - Similar principle

**CD-8** T-cell

![[Pasted image 20210716234647.png]]

- Examples:
	- **Graft rejection** (not hyperacute)
	- Virus and tumor infected cells
		- NK-cells also kill them the difference is:
			- Dependence on MHC class I for CD8+ cell
			-  NK cell does MHC independent killing
			-  HBV and HBC 
	-  Type 1 Diabetes - CTLs (Cytotoxic T- lymphocytes) damage pancreatic beta cells -> ==insulitis==
	-  CD8 T+ also ==secrete IFN-gamma==





[^GravesDisease]: Graves disease is the most common cause of [hyperthyroidism](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/bg0HF2#Z7efc7350132a2f2a3e4cc7763e7f07f8) and often affects women. It is an autoimmune condition that is associated with circulating [TSH receptor](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Z4da1b4a6b1428d56a3df7ecca2157124) [autoantibodies](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z07ff4a8efdae49ba17ed2b65e3db534d) leading to overstimulation of the [thyroid gland](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Za09b3ec4cbcf889fc4f7b34cecb45f4d) with excess [thyroid hormone production](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Z77fd6faa2e14dbbd6b924ef6a6a58e2b).
[^MG]:Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by generalized muscle weakness. The pathophysiology of MG involves [autoantibodies](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z07ff4a8efdae49ba17ed2b65e3db534d) directed against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AchR), thereby impairing neuromuscular transmission.

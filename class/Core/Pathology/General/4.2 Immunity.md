# Hypersensitivity Reaction

- The immune system inititates collateral damage 

**Gel Coombs Classification:**

## Type I Hypersensitivity Reaction

### 1. Sensitization

1. Antigen is internalized by APC
2. Antigen is presented to the Th2 T-cell (CD4+)
3. T-Cell Activation occurs
4. Production of cytokines:
	- **IL-4** - Secretion of IgE and B-cell activation
	- **IL-5** - Recruitment of Eosinophils
	- **IL-13** - Mucus secretion

- The produced IgE attaches to mast cell IgE cross-link receptor modifying it
	- ==No symptoms== in this phase

### 2. Re-exposure

- Upon antigen re-entry, the IgE attches to the antigen which then cross-links with Mast cells that were modified
- This causes degranulation and release of chemicals
	1. **Acute/Pre-formed/Early Phase**
		- These chemicals are pre-formed and are released immediately
		- They include chemicals such as 
			- ***Histamines***
			- ***Protease***
			- **Eosinophil Chemotactic Factor**
	2. **Late phase**
		- **AA-metabolites**
			- LT4s - causes bronchospasm
			- PG2s - esp. PGB<sub>2</sub>
		- **Cytokines** 
			- TNF-alpha
			- IL-1
			- IL-4
			- IL-5
			- IL-13

## Type II Hypersensitivity Reaction
 
Also known as **Ab mediated HSR/Cytocytic HSR**

| Type 1              | Type 2                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| IgE played the role | IgG or IgM plays the role                  |
|                     | Presence of antigens on surface of tissues |
|                     |                                            |

**Mechanisms**
### Opsonization

![[Pasted image 20210716012037.png]]

Examples:
- Mismatch b Blood Transfusion Reaction
- Erythroblastosis Fetalis
- ***Autoimmune hemolytic anemia***
- ***Autoimmune thrombocytopenia***
- ***Autoimmune leucopenia***

### Inflammation

- The antigen-antibody complex activates complement system C3a/C5a
- Neutrophili/macrophages chemotoxis
- Leads to ==Tissue damage==
- ***Examples***
	- **Acute Rheumatic Fever**
		- The antigen of bacteria (strep.) is similar to cardiac tissue and joints
		- the antibodies produced against these antigens attack this
	- **ANCA-mediated Vasculitis**
		- ANCA - Anti-neutrophilic Cytoplasmic Antibodies
	- Goodpasture syndrome
		- Goodpasture syndrome also referred to as anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, is an **autoimmune disease** that affects both the kidneys and lungs by the formation of autoantibodies that attack their basement membranes
		- The non-helical protruding part of non-collagenous chain is the antigen against which antibodies are formed
		- Good- Glomerular
		- Pasture- Pulmonary
	- **Pemphigus vulgaris**
		- Epidermal cells are attaked
		- Presents as bullaes
	- Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid


### Cellular Dysfunction

- The presence of antibodies lead to Cellular Dysfunction
- This was also know as ==Type V== hypersensitivity reaction
- An antibody stimulates a receptor
	- e.g **Graves Disease** [^GravesDisease]
		- Leading cause for hyperthyroidism
	- **Myasthenia Gravis** [^MG]
		- Antibody against ==Acetyl choline==
	- **Pernicious anemia**
		- Intrinisic factor due to abnormal antibodies
	- **Insulin resistant** Diabetes melitus
		- Antibodies againt insulin receptor

## Type III Hypersensitivity

-  Also known as **Immune Complex Disease**


**Phase I**: Formation of antigen-antibody complexes
- Takes about ==5-7 days==
- Antigen entry -> Antibody formation -> Antigen-antibody binding

**Phase II** : Deposition of immune complexes
- [Immune complexes](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/ek0x5T#Z0aff747d9f89fdeec50df1ff21c79737) are deposited in tissue, especially blood vessels → initiation of [complement cascade](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1K022S#Z4e039511154b5fb4a8ed8e333cff7f04) → release of [lysosomal](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Lo0wcS#Z62243fdb434fa6a2028d74238955fc58) enzymes from [neutrophils](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/ln0vtg#Zd36074c54a3f63afa3afea2a3d7d26db) → [cell death](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/VP0GdT#Zb3483fa4a700b90a3cd8ccb27fb6b899) → [inflammation](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/j50_Pg#Za5de83449ff6a749e6c1348b93b1f3b1) → [vasculitis](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/fT0kJ2#Z65c5d02013e50d4a2715ee8ae8d47b02)
- Deposition occurs in ultafiltration organs et. cetera
- e.g: 
	- **Kidney** - glomerulonephritis
	- **Serosa**
	- **Lymph Nodes** - such as lymphadenopathy
	- **Skin**
	- **Synovium**

- ==10-14 days== lag time
- Thus it's also known as **Delayed Type Hypersensitivity**
- Immune-complexes that are ***medium*** sized are the most dangerous 
	- small ones are non-pathogenic
	- large ones result in acute manifestations with lagsss

In **Acute SLE**: 
- ==Serum C3== levels is reduced due to excessive activation of complement cascade indicative of **active** disease

:::


## Hypersensitivity IV Reaction

- This is **==CELL MEDIATED==** hypersensitivity and not antibodies 
- **CD4+ T-cell involvement**
	- Leads to **Delayed Type Hypersensitivity**
	- Antigen presents to APC 
	- Activates Th1 or Th17
		- When IFN-gamma is secreted -> IFN-gamma -> Th1 cell
		- When IL-1, IL-6, IL-23 is secreted -> Th17 activation -> ==**Memory cell**==
		- On **re-exposure**:
			- Th1 cell production increases
			- Lymphoctoxin increases
			- Macrophage activation
			- **Formation of Granuloma**
		-  Primary Th1 activation -> more macrophages are seen in granuloma
		-  Primary Th17 activation -> more neutrophilic infiltration

> **Tuberculin test/Mantoux test**
> - 0.1ml purified protein derivative of mycobacterium microbe is given into forearm intradermal
> - in non-exposed individuals, it leads to formation of antibodies
> - however in exposed indivduals, it is re-exposure, thus forming **granulomas** and **swelling**
> - Thus after 72 hours, measurement of the induration
> - It is a check of if the person has been exposed to mycobacteria AND if immune system is working
> **Lepromin test**
> - Similar principle

**CD-8** T-cell

![[Pasted image 20210716234647.png]]

- Examples:
	- **Graft rejection** (not hyperacute)
	- Virus and tumor infected cells
		- NK-cells also kill them the difference is:
			- Dependence on MHC class I for CD8+ cell
			-  NK cell does MHC independent killing
			-  HBV and HBC 
	-  Type 1 Diabetes - CTLs (Cytotoxic T- lymphocytes) damage pancreatic beta cells -> ==insulitis==
	-  CD8 T+ also ==secrete IFN-gamma==

# Tolerance
- It is the response to self-antigens
[[4.1 Immunity#^248750]] [[4.1 Immunity#^611163]]

- The unresponsiveness of an organism's immune system to antigens that are expressed by the organism's own cells. There are two types of mechanisms of immune tolerance: central (e.g., negative selection of T cells) and peripheral (e.g., suppression of lymphocyte activation).
- When this property is lost -> autoimmune disorders
- Two types
	
	
## 1. Central Tolerance
- Occurs in thymus, bone marrow - sites of T/B-cell proliferation

![[Pasted image 20210717202250.png]]


### Negative selection
- Occurs in the medulla for T-cells and Bone Marrow for B cells
	- Dendritic cells and medullary epithelial cells in the thymus express a wide array of self-antigens to test the T-cell and when binded, apoptosis
	- AIRE is responsible for expression of some subtypes of antigens
- Normally self-reactive both B/T cells are killed off through clonal deletion
	- This is via apoptosis
- ==AIRE== gene codes for autoimmune regulator
- Mutations cause type 1 ***autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome***
	- Thyroidism
	- Adrenal
	- Candida
-   Location: [thymic medulla](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/960NMS#Z468b470189fc5ae6488fcdcba6ecf8c1)
-   Tests if [T cells](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Zb648e3ccdd39ac912f7d40f71b5d94c0) bind to tissue-restricted self-antigens presented on [MHC](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1K022S#Zdea35a4936592a360c121f339a446a70) by [thymic](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/960NMS#Z2280a528c47a8e93bb70fb96d798d351) medullary cells
    -   [T cells](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Zb648e3ccdd39ac912f7d40f71b5d94c0) that do not bind receive survival signal.
    -   [T cells](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Zb648e3ccdd39ac912f7d40f71b5d94c0) that bind self-antigens undergo [apoptosis](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/VP0GdT#Ze3b1d969dabac0178de882d11ad4ffbf), except for a few that become regulatory [T cells](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Zb648e3ccdd39ac912f7d40f71b5d94c0).
-   Self-antigen presentation is mediated by the [autoimmune regulator protein](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/tM0Xqg#Zbf7a09ac4267185e155471718558fdf7) ([AIRE protein](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/tM0Xqg#Zbf7a09ac4267185e155471718558fdf7)), dysfunction of which can lead to:
    -   [Adrenal insufficiency](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Ug0bu2#Z9506c5c93356b984bdd17a7d48a36997)
    -   [Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/tM0Xqg#Z250c8f7b55f429db970a3a85b3c8259a)
    -   [Hypoparathyroidism](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Sg0yu2#Zc6f73f840fa12edb04fdb347942de27d)

> “Life is ACHe without AIRE”: Autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE) dysfunction can lead to Adrenal insufficiency, chronic mucocutaneous Candidiasis, and Hypoparathyroidism.
		

### Receptor editing
- Occurs in Bone marrow, only for B-Cell
- In this, an attempt to change the specificity of the [antigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen "Antigen") receptor of self reactive immature B-cells, in order to rescue them from apoptosis occurs.
- Same test of self-antigen expression by dendritic cells occurs
- RAG genes will be reexpressed which allows editing of immunoglobulin thus modifying binding affinity
- If not, it contunues to apoptosis


## Peripheral Tolerance
- Occurs in  lymph nodes, spleen, systemic circulation


### Anergy

- This is the functional hyporesponsiveness to self-antigens
- Most self antigens do not induce **co-stimulatory** signals
- These self-antigens produce
	- Increased **CTLA-4**
	- Increased **PD-1**
	- These molecules are negative co-stimulatory signal generating molecules
	- Cancer cells also preferentially attach to negative co-stimulatory signal generating
		- New class of anti-cancer drugs are targetting this
- **T-cell anergy** - Decreased Interaction between B7(CD80/86) and CD-28
- **B-Cell Anergy** -Decreased Interaction between CD40 and CD40L


### T-Regulatory Cells
These are CD4+ CD25+ FOXp3+ cells
- Especially seen in development of normal fetus inside pregnant mother (acceptance of fetus)
- T-reg cells secrete Anti-inflammatory cytokines - **IL-10** and **TGF-beta**
	- IL-10 inhibits expression of ***MHC Class II ***and ***B7***
- It expresses CTLA-4 and PD-1 - **decreased** activation of B and T cell
- T-reg cells have **Interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain** (==CD25==) essential for normal functioning
	- Polymporphism of IL-2RA/ CD25 leads to **==Multiple Sclerosis==** (one of many causes)
	- **IPEX** syndrome - ==FOXp3== [^FOX]
	
| Mnemonic |                    |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| I        | Immune dysfunction |
| P        | Polyendocrinopathy |
| E        | Enteropathy        |
| X        | X-linked disease   | 

### Antigen Sequestration
- Immune-privilege site - antigens are hidden/sequestered
	- **B**: Brain - except ***Area postrema***/ Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (==CTZ==)
	- **E**: Eye - except ***optic nerve***
	- **T**: Testes - except ***epididymis***

- When trauma occurs to these tissues, exposure to antigens occurs and thus antibodies are formed
	- e.gL Orchitis, Opthalmitis

### Deletion of Self-reactive B/T-cells
- Repeated attachment to antigen without co-stimulatory signals lead to apoptosis
- Higher expression of FAS-Ligand of self reactive T and B cells
	- Defective FasL and FAS (CD95) leads to ==autoimmunle lymphoproliferative syndrome==
		- **A** - Anemias, thrombocytopenias
		- **L** - Lymph adenopathy
		- **P** - 
		- **S** - Spleenomegaly
		- Leads to Lymphoma eventually
	- [[class/Core/Pathology/General/1. Cell Injury]] 
	- **BIM** is able to directly ==activate== ***Bax/Bak*** to cause permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and induce apoptosis. In contrast to AICD, the killing of antigen-activated T cells during shutdown of an immune response to an acute infection requires Bim, but not Fas

### Genetic Factors
- Failure of Tolerance as seen above
- HLA gene defect
	- HLA-B27 - **Ankylosing spondylitis**
- Non-HLA Genes
	- PTPN-22 gene defect
		- This is responsible for controlled lymphocyte proliferation
		- Defect leads to uncontrolled proliferation with loss of tolerance
		- Mutation is gain of function
	- NOD gene defect
		- NOD acts as a pattern recognizer (and is vital for commensal GI bacteria's existence)
		- Inflammatory Bowel Disease - **NOT A CLASSICAL AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER**
	- IL-2R gene defect
		- Leads to Multiple sclerosis
		- Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

### Infections
**Mechanisms**:
- Increased costimulatory signals -> excessive APC activation
- Molecular mimicry
	- Seen in rheumatic fever
	- Strep antigen antibodies attack host tissue due to similarity
	- May also lead to spreading of cryptic epitope
		- A cryptic epitope is defined as a hidden or sequestered epitope that is processed and presented more efficiently ***as a result of an inflammatory immune response*** initiated by either a dominant epitope, as in a response to an infectious agent, or revealed as a result of the diversification of the response secondary to self tissue damage, as in an autoimmune response.
			- Hidden Ag is exposed
		- It is seen in multiple AI disorders including **Rheumatic Heart Disease** (Rheumatic fever)
		- **EPITOPE SPREADING** is the reason for ==Overlapping Features==
- Polyclonal B-cell Activation
	- Done by ==HIV and EBV==
	- Due to excessive induction of proliferation of B cells, there's higher chances of autoimmune self-reactive B-cells to form

> ![[Pasted image 20210717193638.png]]

### Miscellaneous
- Hormones
	- Estrogen and progestrone
	- Estrogen reduces apoptosis of self-reactive B cells
- UV-light
	- esp. in SLE
- Release of sequestered antigens
- Drugs: esp -
	- **S**: Sulfonamide
	- **H**: Hydralzine
	- **I**: Isoniazid
	- **P**: Procainamide

> Trigger is very very vital
> - Enviromental trigger in genetically susceptible individuals is the most likely etiology
> - There is increased incidence in twins
> - Environmental triggers lead to bystander activation or molecular mimicry
>   - Bystander activation is the **activation of T cells specific for an antigen X during an immune response against antigen Y** . May occur during viral infections.

# Systemic Lupus Erythematatous

- This is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease
	- Presents as ==flares== and remissions are common
	- More common in Middle-aged females, esp. African American and Hispanic (**10:1 female to male**)
		- As noted before, estrogen reduces apoptosis of self-reactive B cells
	- Occurs in children too (2:1 female to male) - lesser female bias
- It is a multisystem disorder

![[Pasted image 20210718003135.png]]

- ==**Type III Hypersensitivity Disorder**== - [[#Type III Hypersensitivity]] + Secondary ==Type II== in blood
	- Poorly formed apoptotic debris, such as from UV light, activates self reactive lymphocytes, which then produce antibodies against the host nuclear antigen
	- These antigen-antibody complexes are initially at low levels, but when taken up by APCs such as dendritic cells, DNA antigens activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) -> IFN-alpha -> amplification
	- This leads to higher number of Ag-Ab complexes and these deposit in the tissue
	- Usually this is cleared out by the complement cascade (classical pathway)
	- C1 -> C4 -> C4bC2b -> C4bC2b3b [C3 convertase]   [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Complement System]]
		- Thus ==Early Complement Protein== [C1q, C4, C2] deficiency is associated with 50% risk of developing Lupus. 
			- Most common deficiency is of **C2**
		- ==CH50 an indicator of classical pathway is reduced==
- **Any tissue can be involved**
- **Clinical Features**
	1. Fever, weight loss, fatigue
		- Inflammatory and non-specific
	- lymphadenopathy
		- due to excessive activation of immune system
		- Non-specific
	- Raynaud phenomenon
		- Change in color of finger sequentially due to **a problem that causes decreased blood flow to the fingers**.
		- Here due to loss of blood supply -> **white** fingers
		- Over time due to ischemia -> **blue** fingers esp. when exposed to cold, stress
		- Return of blood -> **red** esp. when exposed to hot
		- It is again non-specific
	2. Malar butterfly rash - **acute cutaneous lupus**
		- Occurs on exposure to sunlight
		- It is non-specific but very relevant
		- Due to degeneration of basal layer of epidermal layer due to antibodies present in dermo-epidermal layer

		![[Pasted image 20210717223506.png]]

	-	Discoid rash  - **chronic cutaneous lupus**
		-	It is the reason lupus got it's named due to it's wolf-bite like lesion

     ![[Pasted image 20210717225906.png]]
	3.	Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers - painless
	4.	Arthritis
		- *Non-erosive*
		- No deformity
		- Most common feature
	5. Serositis
		-	Pleuritis
			-	Shrinking lung syndrome *(smaller diaphragm)*
			-	Pleural effusion maybe seen
		-	Pericarditis
			-	
	6.	Psychosis or seizures
	7.	Renal damage
		-	Nephritic Syndrome
			-	Diffuse proliferaltive glomerulonephritis (**Tyoe IV GN**)
			-	Most common
		-	Nephrotic Syndrome	
			-	Membranous glomerulonephritis
		-	Combination of both
		-	No damage at all
		-	Other features:
			-	Wire loop lesions
				-	Due to subendothelial emmune complex deposition
	8. Anemia, thrombocytpoenia or leukopenia from **==Type II hypersensitive reaction==** [[#Type II Hypersensitivity Reaction]]
		- Associated with Auto Ab [10%] and anemia of chronic disease [60%]
	9. Libman-sacks endocarditis [vegetations on both sides of the valve]
		- Different from normal endocarditis as it is only one side in such endocarditis
		- Lower surface is predominantly involved [LSE - Lower surface]
		- Vegetations are fibrins and platelets
		- **SLE -> LSE** (mnemonic)
	10. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) - **Mosr sensitive** but ***not specific***
		- As it may also be seen in other AI diseases and is also present in 5% of population
	11. Anti-dsDNA or Anti-Sm (Smith) are highly **==specific==**
		- ==Anti-dsDNA is prognostic==
			- It is associated with disease activity and renal nephritis
			- Relapse can also be tested
	- ==Antiphospholipid antibody== is also associated with SLE (one-third of patients).
		- These are due to cryptic epitope exposure of phospholipids due to antibody attack on proteins attached to phospholipis
		- Anticardiolipin - 
			- False positive VDRL and RPR - syphilis screening test as they look for anticardiolipin antibodies and the reagent is cardiolipin
			- Thus lupus coagulant is tested for via==DRVVT== - Dilute Russel Viper Venom Test
		- Lupus Anticoagulant
			- False PTT increased time
		- Anti-Beta2-glycoprotein I

:::{.sticky-note}

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by hypercoagulable state due to antiphospholipid antibodies (**especially lupus anticoagulant**). 
 1. Results in arterial and venous thrombosis including deep venous, hepatic vein, placental (recurrent pregnancy loss), and cerebral (stroke) thrombosis 
 2. Requires ==lifelong anticoagulation ==
 3. Associated with SLE; however, ***more commonly occurs as a primary disorder*** - SLE is a secondary cause of APLA

Treatment for SLE is
- Avoid exposure to sunlight
- Glucocorticoids for flares
- Other immunosuppressive agents in severe and refractory disease

**Renal failure, infections and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis ==(late onset)==** are common causes of death

***Cellular morphology that may  be seen***

**LE Cell**
 ANA damages nuclear chromatin
 - The cell which results from this is called Lupus Erythematosus body
 - Neutrophils and macrophages phagocytize leads to formation of ==LE Cell==
	 - Denatured nuclear material is present
 - Its also present in Rheumatoid arthritis and drug induced lupus
 Historically, LE Cell was used to diagnose SLE, however it no longer is.

 **TART cell**
 - **A granulocyte that has engulfed the nucleus of another cell**, the structure of which is still well preserved. This type of ingested nucleus, especially as found as an artifact in lupus erythematosus cell preparations.

**Emperipolesis**
- Emperipolesis is **the presence of an intact cell within the cytoplasm of another cell**, an uncommon biological process, and can be physiological or pathological. Also called band cell
- Seen with Rosai Dorfan disease, Hodgkin lymphoma, Myeloid neoplasms - AML, CML, MDS, MPD

[^GravesDisease]: Graves disease is the most common cause of [hyperthyroidism](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/bg0HF2#Z7efc7350132a2f2a3e4cc7763e7f07f8) and often affects women. It is an autoimmune condition that is associated with circulating [TSH receptor](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Z4da1b4a6b1428d56a3df7ecca2157124) [autoantibodies](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z07ff4a8efdae49ba17ed2b65e3db534d) leading to overstimulation of the [thyroid gland](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Za09b3ec4cbcf889fc4f7b34cecb45f4d) with excess [thyroid hormone production](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/i60JkS#Z77fd6faa2e14dbbd6b924ef6a6a58e2b).
[^MG]:Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by generalized muscle weakness. The pathophysiology of MG involves [autoantibodies](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/x50Emg#Z07ff4a8efdae49ba17ed2b65e3db534d) directed against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AchR), thereby impairing neuromuscular transmission.
[^FOX]:  A **function of FOXP3** is to suppress the **function** of NFAT and NFkappaB and this leads to suppression of expression of many genes including IL-2 and effector T-cell cytokines.

Plasia - Growth

1.  Even when there is no stimulus ( such as growth factor), the cell continues replicating - distinct from hyperplasia and repair
2.  Monoclonal Growth
	- Clonality determines number of cells involved in replication of a clone
	- Monoclonal: Cells are derived from a single progenitor cell
	- Polyclonal: Multiple cells produce daughter cells
	- Clonality was historically determined by G6PD enzyme isoforms, but androgen receptor isoforms can be used (Both are present on X-chromosome)
		1. G6PD have multiple isoforms - A, B, C, D etcetra
		2. In females, only one isoform is inherited from each parent - X-linked inheritance
		3. One isoform is randolmly inactivated by **lyonization** which inactivates one X chromosome at random
		4. Normal ratio of active isoforms in any cell of a tissue is 1:1 
			 - 50% of cells have G6PD-A and 50% have G6PDB
		 5. When hyperplasia occurs in these cells, 1:1 ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, as the derivative of hyperplasic cells is polyclonal
		 6. Only one isoform is present in **neoplasia** 
			 - As growth is monoclonal, thus only one isoform is present
3. Clonality of B-lymphocytes is determined by immunoglobulin light chain phenotype
	- Ig is comprised of heavy and light chains 
		- B cells express light chain phenotypes that are: kappa or lambda
		- Normal kappa to lambda ratio is 3:1
			- This ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, such as during infection, which again is polyclonal
			- When neoplasic growth such as **lymphoma** occurs, ratio is pushed to >6:1 or is inverted (Κ:γ - 1:3 or > 1:6) - due to monoclonal growth

- Choristoma
	- Normal tissue at an abnormal site [Ectopic rest of normal tissue]
- Hamartoma
	- Abnormal tissue at normal sites
		- Most common site -> ***Lungs***
	- Considered as preneoplastic lesions

- Teratoma ->
	- Growth in Totipotent cells

## Components of Neoplasm
1. Parenchyma
	- Refers to the proliferating neoplastic cells
2. Stroma
	- Refers to the connective tissue material present in the neoplasm

- When there is more stroma -> Firm appearance -**Desmoplasia**
	- Linitis plastica - adenocarcinoma of stomach wall - leather-bottle appearance
	- Colon cancer
	- Breast cancer

- When Parenchyma -> Medullary appearance

## Features of Neoplasia
### 1. Anaplasia

- There's a total absence of differentiation
- Nucleo:Cytoplasmic ratio can show this
		- Normal N:C ratio - 1:4
		- Anaplastic N:C ratio - 1:1
		- Histology shows highly basophilic

	![[Pasted image 20210703183310.png]]
- Anaplastic cells show high pleomorphism
	- Different morphologies - high variability
- Anaplastic cells undergo abnormal mitosis
	- Normal cells form 2 mitotic spindles -> 2 daughter cells are produced
	- Anaplastic cells have more than 2 spindles
		- 3 spindles: Tripolar spindles
		- 4 spindles: Quadripolar spindles
			
			![[Pasted image 20210703183532.png]]
	- Abnormal giant cells
		- Reed sternberg cells [[2. Inflammation#^422fa8]]

		![[Pasted image 20210703184107.png]]
	- Totally irreversible Condition

> - AN - Abnormal Nucleocytoplasmic ratio - very high
> - A - Abnormal mitosis
> - PL - Pleomorphism, loss of polarity
> - ASIA - IRREVERSIBLE

### 2. Rapid Rate of Growth
	- Minimum mass of tumor cells to be detected clinically is -> Billion (10^9) cells (1g of tumor cells)
	- [[#^a2faae]]
	- Maximum number of cells compaitable with life -> Trillion (10^12) cells

> Warber effect
>	- Even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, cancer/tumor cells undergo Glycolysis
>	- Pyurvate -> Intermediates -> Growth Factors synthesis
						
	18 FDG - radioactive glucose sub-type that is non-metabolized is given to the patient
	- As tumor cells leadto angiogenesis and thus are more vascularized, this 18-FDG is concentrated in the tumor. Normal cells have diffuse distribution of 18-FDG
	- PET scan is done to localize tumors

### 3. Invasion
	- Tumor cells secrete VEGF and FGF
		- They are responsible for angiogenesis
		- Thus they are playing facilitatory role in the growth and spread of tumors
	- Without angiogenesis, tumor cells can grow only upto 1-2 mm

Anti-angiogenetics such as Angiostatin, endostatin [NATURAL] and drugs like Bevacizumab inhibit angiogenesis

| Carcinoma                     | Carcinoma In Situ                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basement Membrane is affected | Basement membrane is not affected                                       |
|                               | Carcinoma is found only in the place where it first formed in the body  |
|                               | It is also known as preinvasive/non-invasive tumor - **Stage 0 Cancer** |

### 4. Metastasis
- It is the most reliable feature of Malignancy
	- Pheochromocytoma
	- Follicular thyroid tumor
		- Follicular adenoma - benign
		- Follicular carcinoma - malignant -metasasis

> Malignancy maybe present without metastasis in:
> 1. Basal cell carcinoma - Skin
> 2. Glioma - CNS tumor

**Metastasis are spread through:**
1. Lymphatic spread - Property of Carcinomas
	- Tumor cells are generally spread first to Sentinel lymph-nodes 
		- Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as the first lymph node (or nodes) on a direct lymphatic drainage pathway from a primary tumor site, and as such, is hypothesized as the most likely location to harbor occult metastasis.
		- These sentinel lymph nodes are used for assessing prognosis [the likely course of a medical condition.]
			- If on biopsy, tumor cells are negative, it usually means that the cancer is localized -> Good prognosis as spread is limited
			- If biopsy is positive, then the prognosis is **poor** and the spread is more extensive
		- SLNs are prognostic and can tell the extent of surgery
			- Useful for 
			1. Breast cancer
			2. Vulval cancer
			3. Melanoma
	- Lymphatic spread does not occur in the following carcinomas: RCH - Red Chilli Hot (Peppers ded sad I ate the peppers fuck me)
		-  Renal Cell Carcinoma
		- Choriocarcioma  
		- Hepatocellular Carcinoma

		- These spread through Hematogenous route
	- Sarcomas with lymphatic spread
		- **S**: Synovial
		- **C**: Cell Clear Sarcoma 
		- **A**: Angiosarcoma
		- **R**: Rhabdomyosarcoma
		- **E**: Epithelial Cell Sarcoma
	
2. Hematogenous Spread
- Tumor cells penetrate venous walls better than artery due to thickness of the wall being higher in the latter
- Any part that receives more blood have higher metastatic spread
	- Lungs >> Liver >> Kidneys(?)
- **SCARE** sarcomas have lymphatic spread

3. Direct Seeding
	- Body cavities are involved directly
		- Pleural cavity: Lung Cancer, Mesothelioma
		- Pericardial Cavity: Cardiac cancer, Lung cancer
		- Peritoneal Cavity:
			- Most commonly affected in direct seeding
			- Responsible for
				- Omental Caking - thickened omentum
				- Malignant Ascites - accumulation of fluid
					- Tumor markers such as Ca125 can assess the prognosis
			- Commonly seen in ovarian tumors, esp. at older age
4. Cerebrospinal Fluid - very rare
	- Drop metastasis - drop by drop CSF fa
	- Seen in brain tumor: Medulloblastoma

## Screening
- Approximately 30 divisions (1,073,741,824) occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise
 ^a2faae
- Each division -> Increased chances of Increased mutation
	- Cancers such as pancreatic, ovarian, lung carcinoma - cancers that are detected late are due to large growth area
		- These do not produce symptoms until late in the disease and would have undergone beyond >30 divisions thus are very mutated cells
		- Thus these cancers have poor prognosis
- Screening seeks to lead to Detection of Dysplasia; Or detect carcinoma before clinical symptoms are manifested
	- e.g: Pap Smear: detects cervical dysplasia
	- Mammography - detects in situ breast cancer before invasion -> or detect before clinically palpable
	- Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Digital Rectal Exam (DRE): detection before carcinoma spreads
		- Prostate carcinoma grows in the periphery thus doesn't supress the urethra like in BPH
		- Thus it is silent
- Hemoccult (blood in stool) test and colonoscopy: detect colonic *adenoma* before it becomes colonic carcinoma / before it spreads

Plasia - Growth==

1.  Even when there is no stimulus ( such as growth factor), the cell continues replicating - distinct from hyperplasia and repair
2.  Monoclonal Growth
	- Clonality determines number of cells involved in replication of a clone
	- Monoclonal: Cells are derived from a single progenitor cell
	- Polyclonal: Multiple cells produce daughter cells
	- Clonality was historically determined by G6PD enzyme isoforms, but androgen receptor isoforms can be used (Both are present on X-chromosome)
		1. G6PD have multiple isoforms - A, B, C, D etcetra
		2. In females, only one isoform is inherited from each parent - X-linked inheritance
		3. One isoform is randolmly inactivated by **lyonization** which inactivates one X chromosome at random
		4. Normal ratio of active isoforms in any cell of a tissue is 1:1 
			 - 50% of cells have G6PD-A and 50% have G6PDB
		 5. When hyperplasia occurs in these cells, 1:1 ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, as the derivative of hyperplasic cells is polyclonal
		 6. Only one isoform is present in **neoplasia** 
			 - As growth is monoclonal, thus only one isoform is present
3. Clonality of B-lymphocytes is determined by immunoglobulin light chain phenotype
	- Ig is comprised of heavy and light chains 
		- B cells express light chain phenotypes that are: kappa or lambda
		- Normal kappa to lambda ratio is 3:1
			- This ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, such as during infection, which again is polyclonal
			- When neoplasic growth such as **lymphoma** occurs, ratio is pushed to >6:1 or is inverted (Κ:γ - 1:3 or > 1:6) - due to monoclonal growth

- Choristoma
	- Normal tissue at an abnormal site [Ectopic rest of normal tissue]
- Hamartoma
	- Abnormal tissue at normal sites
		- Most common site -> ***Lungs***
	- Considered as preneoplastic lesions

- Teratoma ->
	- Growth in Totipotent cells
	- Arises from 1 germ cell layer
		- Most common site: Gonads > Mediatinum
[[MRS]]

## Components of Neoplasm
1. Parenchyma
	- Refers to the proliferating neoplastic cells
2. Stroma
	- Refers to the connective tissue material present in the neoplasm

- When there is more stroma -> Firm appearance -**Desmoplasia**
	- Linitis plastica - adenocarcinoma of stomach wall - leather-bottle appearance
	- Colon cancer
	- Breast cancer

- When Parenchyma -> Medullary appearance

## Features of Neoplasia
### 1. Anaplasia

- There's a total absence of differentiation
- Nucleo:Cytoplasmic ratio can show this
		- Normal N:C ratio - 1:4
		- Anaplastic N:C ratio - 1:1
		- Histology shows highly basophilic

	![[Pasted image 20210703183310.png]]
- Anaplastic cells show high pleomorphism
	- Different morphologies - high variability
- Anaplastic cells undergo abnormal mitosis
	- Normal cells form 2 mitotic spindles -> 2 daughter cells are produced
	- Anaplastic cells have more than 2 spindles
		- 3 spindles: Tripolar spindles
		- 4 spindles: Quadripolar spindles
			
			![[Pasted image 20210703183532.png]]
	- Abnormal giant cells
		- Reed sternberg cells [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^422fa8]]

		![[Pasted image 20210703184107.png]]
	- Totally irreversible Condition

> - AN - Abnormal Nucleocytoplasmic ratio - very high
> - A - Abnormal mitosis
> - PL - Pleomorphism, loss of polarity
> - ASIA - IRREVERSIBLE

> ![[Pasted image 20210703184253.png]]

### 2. Rapid Rate of Growth
- Minimum mass of tumor cells to be detected clinically is -> Billion (10^9) cells (1g of tumor cells) [[#^a2faae]]
- Maximum number of cells compaitable with life -> Trillion (10^12) cells

> **Warburg effect**
>	- Even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, cancer/tumor cells undergo Glycolysis
>	- Pyurvate -> Intermediates -> Growth Factors synthesis -> Tumor cell proliferation
>	- This is basically Aerobic Glycolysis but no EMP
>	- Physiologically seen in embryonic tissues, lymphoid cells where M2 isoform of pyurvate kinase is present
						
	18 FDG - radioactive glucose sub-type that is non-metabolized is given to the patient
	- As tumor cells leadto angiogenesis and thus are more vascularized, this 18-FDG is concentrated in the tumor. Normal cells have diffuse distribution of 18-FDG
	- PET scan is done to localize tumors

### 3. Invasion
- Tumor cells secrete VEGF and FGF
	- They are responsible for angiogenesis
	- Thus they are playing facilitatory role in the growth and spread of tumors
- Without angiogenesis, tumor cells can grow only upto ==1-2 mm==

:::{.sticky-note}
Anti-angiogenetics such as Angiostatin, endostatin [NATURAL] and drugs like Bevacizumab inhibit angiogenesis

| Carcinoma                     | Carcinoma In Situ                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basement Membrane is affected | Basement membrane is not affected                                       |
|                               | Carcinoma is found only in the place where it first formed in the body  |
|                               | It is also known as preinvasive/non-invasive tumor - **Stage 0 Cancer** |

### 4. Metastasis
- It is the most reliable feature of Malignancy
	- Pheochromocytoma
	- Follicular thyroid tumor
		- Follicular adenoma - benign
		- Follicular carcinoma - malignant -metasasis

- Eventual accumulation of mutations results in invasion and spread
**Characteristics**
- Downregulation of E-cadherin
	- Cadherin keep cells attached with one another
	- For tumor cells to spread, downregulation of E-cadherin
	- The cell is attached to basement membrane - collagen IV and laminin [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^9c610e]]
		- Cell that detaches from neighbouring cells attach to the basement membrane by laminin
		- Then they proceed to secrete collagenase and breakdown the collagen IV 
		- In the extracellular matrix, cells attach to fibronectin [^wtfisthis] and spreads locally
		- It may gain access to vascular (hematogenous spread) or lymphatic spaces
- Epithelial -> Mesenchymal Transition: 
	- For spread of tumor, properties are up regulated and mesenchymal property is down regulated
	
	![[Pasted image 20210707104535.png]]


> Malignancy maybe present without metastasis in:
> 1. Basal cell carcinoma - Skin
> 2. Glioma - CNS tumor

**Metastasis are spread through:**
1. Lymphatic spread - Property of ==Carcinomas==
	- Tumor cells are generally spread first to ==Sentinel lymph-nodes ==
		- Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is defined as the first lymph node (or nodes) on a direct lymphatic drainage pathway from a primary tumor site, and as such, is hypothesized as the most likely location to harbor occult metastasis.
		- These sentinel lymph nodes are used for assessing prognosis [the likely course of a medical condition.]
			- If on biopsy, tumor cells are negative, it usually means that the cancer is localized -> Good prognosis as spread is limited
			- If biopsy is positive, then the prognosis is **poor** and the spread is more extensive
		- SLNs are prognostic and can tell the extent of surgery
			- Useful for 
			1. Breast cancer
			2. Vulval cancer
			3. Melanoma

		- These spread through Hematogenous route
	- Sarcomas with lymphatic spread
		- **S**: Synovial
		- **C**: Cell Clear Sarcoma 
		- **A**: Angiosarcoma
		- **R**: Rhabdomyosarcoma
		- **E**: Epithelial Cell Sarcoma
	
	![[Pasted image 20210706174513.png]]
	
	
2. Hematogenous Spread
- Tumor cells penetrate ==venous== walls better than artery due to thickness of the wall being higher in the latter
- Sarcomas generally spread through hematogenous spread
- Any part that receives more blood have higher metastatic spread
	- Lungs >> Liver >> Kidneys(?)
- 	- Lymphatic spread does not occur in the following carcinomas: RCHF - Red Chilli Hot Feppers
		-  **R:** Renal Cell Carcinoma
		- **C** Choriocarcioma  (plancental tissue)
		- **H** Hepatocellular Carcinoma
		- **F** Follicular Carcinoma of Thyroid
- **SCARE** sarcomas have lymphatic spread


3. Direct Seeding
	- Body cavities are involved directly
		- Pleural cavity: Lung Cancer, Mesothelioma
		- Pericardial Cavity: Cardiac cancer, Lung cancer
		- Peritoneal Cavity:
			- Most commonly affected in direct seeding
			- Responsible for
				- Omental Caking - thickened omentum

				![[Pasted image 20210706175130.png]]
				- Malignant Ascites - accumulation of fluid
					- Tumor markers such as Ca125 can assess the prognosis
			- Commonly seen in ovarian tumors, esp. at older age

4. Cerebrospinal Fluid - very rare
	- Drop metastasis - drop by drop CSF fa
	- Seen in brain tumor: Medulloblastoma

## Screening
- Approximately ==30 divisions== (1,073,741,824) occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise
 ^a2faae
- Each division -> Increased chances of Increased mutation
	- Cancers such as pancreatic, ovarian, lung carcinoma - cancers that are detected late are due to large growth area
		- These do not produce symptoms until late in the disease and would have undergone beyond >30 divisions thus are very mutated cells
		- Thus these cancers have poor prognosis
- Screening seeks to lead to Detection of Dysplasia; Or detect carcinoma before clinical symptoms are manifested
	- e.g: Pap Smear: detects cervical dysplasia
	- Mammography - detects in situ breast cancer before invasion -> or detect before clinically palpable
	- Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Digital Rectal Exam (DRE): detection before carcinoma spreads
		- Prostate carcinoma grows in the periphery thus doesn't supress the urethra like in BPH
		- Thus it is silent
- Hemoccult (blood in stool) test and colonoscopy: detect colonic *adenoma* before it becomes colonic carcinoma / before it spreads


# Carcinogenesis


> **Hallmarks of Cancer**
> 1. Self sufficiency of Growth Factors
> 2. Insensitivity to growth inhibitors
> 3. Altered Metabolism
> 4. Uncontrolled Replication
> 5. Evasion of Metabolism
> 6. Invasion and Metastasis
> 7. Sustained Angiogenesis
> 8. Evasion of host-immune response
> 9. Tumor promoting inflammation
> 10. Genomic instability
> 11. Warburg effect


- Mutations result in cancer formation
- Carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses and radiation


![[Pasted image 20210704095022.png]]

- **Chemicals**:
	- Aflatoxins -> Hepatocellular carcinoma: Common in Africa
	- Alkylating agents -> due to chemotherapy: ==side efect== [[Antineoplastics]]
	- Alcohol -> SCC of OP, Upper Esophagus, pancreatitis -> pancreatic carcinoma, Cirrhosis -> Hepatocellular carcinoma
	- Arsenic -> SCC of skin, lung cancer **(smoking)**
		- <sup>Woman in england applied Arsenic onto the skin to prevent tan coz they secretly had orgy parties in the sun. Yes. (no they worked in fields lol. maybe they didn't) </sup>
	- Asbestos -> Lung carcinoma >> mesothelioma (pleural)
	- Cigarette smoke ==Most common carcinogen==-> Lung cancer, OP, Esophagus, and ***Kidney and bladder*** (due to concentration of carcinogen while excretion)
	- Nitrosamines -> Intestinal Stomach Carcinoma -
		- <sub>Waifus in japan eat smoked meat ( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛) then get stomach cancer. sed. [^insensitive] </sub>
	- Napthylamine -> derivative of cigarette **smoke**: Urothelial carcinoma of bladder
	- Vinyl chloride -> Angiosarcoma of liver ~> Used in PVC pipe industry - occupational exposure
	- Si, Be, Ni, Cr -> Lung cancer, occupational again
- **Oncogenic**:
	- EBV: *Nasopharyngeal carcinoma*
		- Chinese and African descent more susceptible (like how china debt trapped them lmao)
		- Neck mass presentation
	- HHV-8: Kaposi carcinoma (endothelial cells)
		- E. Eu males @ skin 
		- AIDS patients as secondary infection
		- Transplants due to immunosupression 
	- H-BV and H-CV: -> HPC
	- HTLV-1:  Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma
	- High-risk HPV (Subtypes)
- **Radiation**
	- Ionizing: Papillary carcinoma of thyroid
		- Nuclear reactor accidents and radiothyroid
		- Occurs due to hydroxyl free radicals (ionizing)
	- Non-ionizing: Skin -> Basal>Squamous>Melanoma
		- UVB sunlight radiations
		- Xeroderma pigmenotosum

Disrupted
- Proto-oncogenes
- Tumor supressor genes


### Protooncogenes
- These are genes essential for cell growth and differentiation
	- Mutations in these genes lead to unregulated cellular growth
		- These mutations are ==gain of function mutation==
		- This leads tumor cells to become self-sufficient

![[Pasted image 20210705173150.png]]
- Categories of proto-oncogenes that produce:
	1. Growth Factors
	2. Growth factor receptors
	3. Signal Transducers
	4. Cell Cycle regulators

![[Pasted image 20210705151649.png]]

1. ***Growth Factors***
	* **PDGF** usually divides the astrocyte
		- Mutation of SIS gene leads to astrocyte production of PDGFB (==autocrine==)
		- This autocrine overexpression leads to a loop of overgrowth -> **Astrocytoma** a type of glioma
	* **HGF**: Hepatocyte Growth Factor
		* Liver cancer

2. ***Growth Factor Receptors***
	- When excess growth factor receptors are expressed, a simple stimulus by a single GF -> overstimulation of growth signals
	- These are associated with tyrosine kinase
	* **ERBB2** [HER2/neu] -> amplified in **subset** of ==breast cancer==
		- Trastuzumab is a MAB against HER2/neu
	- **RET** -> ==medullary carcinoma of thyroid==: associated with MEN2A MEN2B
		- MEN2A and 2B are types of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, a syndrome in which tumors are developed in endocrine organs
		- 2A and 2B cause medularry carcinoma of thyroid
		- If ==Pheocromocytoma== or mucosal neuromas (feature of MEN2B) is present, then **RET** mutation studies can be done and if positive, thyroid can be removed [[Endocrine]]
	-  **KIT** -> ==GIT== stromal tumor
	-  **ERB-B1** - lung cancer

3. ***Signal Transducers***
	- Normally 1 receptor molecule has only 1 signal transducer
	- If however multiple signal transducers are produced due to mutation, excess transduction occurs
	- **RAS** gene family
		- 70-80% of cancers are due to this mutation
		- GTP-binding protein function
		- RAS usually sits in off state - GDP with growth factor receptors
			- When activated, GTP is bound, and RAS-GTP complex acts as a messenger
		- RAS has the ability to dephosphorylate
			- Augmented by GTPase Associated Protein - Neurofibromin (an example of tumor suppressor gene)
		- RAS mutations lead to loss of this ability leading to prolonged activated RAS
		- This causes excess transduction
		> K-RAS - Colon Cancer*****
		> H-RAS - Kidney and bladder cancer
		> N-RAS - Melanoma


	- **ABL**
		- Non-receptor Tyrosine kinase (i.e, they are cytosolic rather than receptor bound)
		- ==9:22== translocation
			- ABL:BCR 9:22 switch up
			- This leads to ABL-BCR fusion gene 
				- Leads to overactivity of tyrosine kinase which causes cancer
		- Causes ==CML[^CML] and some ALL[^CML] types== 
			- ALL is usually associated with children
			- ALL with 9:22 translocation has poor prognosis
			- However CML with 9:22 translocation has good prognosis
		- Tyrosine-Kinase addiction by tumors is called oncogene addiction (dependency)
			- This can be treated by Imatinib [[Antineoplastics]]
		- **BRAF**
			- Responsible for MAP kinase
			> - **Hairy cell leukemia - Associated 100%**
			> - Benign Nevi (mole) - Associated 80%
			> - Melanoma - Associated 60%

		- **Beta-catenin** ^8c95e7
			- Responsible for increased MYC (nuclear transcription facor) activity
			- APC gene and E-Cadherin inhibit the activity 
			- Colon cancer - high risk [[#^79b23f]]

4. ***Nuclear Regulators***
	- These are transcription factors that lead to upregulation of growth promoting proteins
	- Also called as master regulator of the cell
	- These increase
		1. Cyclin activity
		2. Telomerase activity
		3. Reprogram -> Stemness (de-differentiation)
	- Mutations in these lead to excess growth promoting proteins
	- **c**-MYC ^79b23f
		- ==Burkitt Lymphoma==
			- translocation 8:14 -> 
			-  Immunoglobin H (IgH) is ON state in Chromosome 14
			-  ==Chromosome 8 contains the MYC gene==
			-  This translocation leads to excess producion of c-MYC leading to high growth of cells **(fastest rate of replication - highest mitotic activity)**
				-  The starry sky appearance is due to:
					1. Tumor cells are sky - blue
					2. White areas : eating cells that are dying
					- Macrophages consume dying cells leadng to starry sky
	- **N**-MYC
		- ==Neuroblastoma==
	- **L**-MYC
		- ==Lung carcinoma ***(Small Cell)***==

5. ***Cell Cycle Regulators***
	- Cell Cycle consists of G1->S [Most regulated step] -> G2 -> M
	- G1 -> S 
		- In this it is made sure that S phase doesn't contain mutations
	- Cyclins activate Cyclin-dependent kinase which phosphorylate
		- Cyclins have OFF/ON state
	- **CCND1** [Cyclin D1]
		- ==11:14== translocation
			- Cyclin D sits on Chromosome 11 and it gets translocated to Chromosome 14 (IgH - ==ON==)
			- Leads to overexpression
		- Mantle cell Lymphoma
			- In a lymph node, the B area (cortex of lymph node), outside the region of the follicle there's a ==Mantle== and outside that there's a Marginal zone

			![[Pasted image 20210705160906.png]]
		- Cyclin D1 is important for regulation of ==G1 -> S== phase


: > DEA Bitch!


| Cyclin | CDK  | Cycle                                   |
| ------ | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| D      | 4, 6 | G0 phase to G1 checkpoint 1 (G1 -> S)   |
| E      | 2    | G1 phase (G1 -> S)                      |
| A      | 2, 1 | S -> G2                                 |
| B      | 1    | Before (Checkpoint 2) and after M phase |



> ![[Pasted image 20210705182159.png]]

: Mutations affecting other CDKs and cyclin E also occur in cancers, but they are infrequent, presumably because these factors are less important in control of the G1 -> S transition, which has a preeminent role in regulating tumor growth rates.

![[Pasted image 20210705182739.png]]

| CDK Inhibitor    | CDK Inhbited |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| p21 - p27 family | All CDKS     |
| p16,17, 18, 19   | CDK4,CDK 6 (**Cyclin D**)             |

### Tumor Supressor Genes
- These are genes that decrease/suppress (as the name says dimwit) the risk of tumor formation
:  e.g: **p53** and ***Retinoblastoma (Rb)***
- Mutations here are ==loss of function mutation==

| Cycle   | Gene    |
| ------- | ------- |
| G1 -> S | Rb, p53 |
| S -> G2 | p53     |

![[Pasted image 20210707092822.png]]

#### p53
* Most common genetic mutation seen in human cancers
* G1 -> S phase traffic cop bitch
* p53 "verifies" DNA integrity before it enter S phase
	* In response to DNA damage, p53 slows the cell cycle and upregulates DNA repair enzymes
	* If DNA repair is not possible, *(such as too many high fucks inside the car wayyy too much cocaine broo)* due to excess mutations, then p53 nukes the entire cell via apoptosis
		1. Calls in BAX which disrupts BCL2 -> Cyt C *(cocaine stash caught rip)* leaks from the cell -> apoptosis

	* **Both** copies of p53 ***must*** be knocked out - ==Knudson two-hit hypothesis== *cops take cocaine rip corrupt crack addicts*
		* Loss is seen in >50% of cancers
		* Germline mutation results in knock out of one copy of p53 (1 corrupt fucker) - in ==Li-Fraumeni syndrome== and the second hit is ==somatic==
			* **S** - Sarcoma
			* **L** - Lymphoma
			* **O** - Osteosarcoma
			* **C** - CNS Tumor
			* **A** - Adrenal Cortex Tumor
			* **B** - Breast Cancer


#### Retinoblastoma (Rb)
:::{.sticky-note}
Retinoblastoma is a cancer that starts in the retina

![[Pasted image 20210705164527.png]]

Retinoblastoma (Rb, RB, RB1) protein is a tumor suppressor protein. It is the most common tumor supressor gene associated with cancers
:::

* G1 -> S 
	 * E2F - a transcription factor is required for this transition
	 * However Retinoblastoma is that old-ass overprotective parent who needs some phosphorylation (dowry) for release of E2F
		 * Guess the dowry? Oh yeah Cyclin D activated CDK4 Complex
	 * The release of E2F lets the G1 to phase into S phase *(change of surname biatch)*
 * However if there's a mutation in Rb, the E2F is constituively free *(rebellious daughter lmao no respect for parents these zoomers)*
 * This results in tumor formation and uncontrolled cell growth
 * Both copies of Rb must be knocked out - Knudson's Two-Hit hypothesis
	 -  *Well, both parents are greedy.. both need dowry... how can you split :(*
		 1.  Sporadic mutation - Hits are somatic -> Unilateral retinoblastoma 
			- During birth, no genes are mutated
			- Bilateral retinoblastoma sporadic mutation is very rare as	in order for tumor to be develop, ==**Both**== copies of Rb gene should be mutated of which the probability is extremely slim 
		2.  Germline mutation - bilateral retinoblastoma and ==osteosarcoma==
			- 1 gene of the allele is mutated (Autosomal dominant)
				- One more mutation in the normal gene leads to loss of this heterozygosity
			- In germline mutation, the chance is higher relatively as one gene is knocked out and mutation of the other normal gene
			- Thus Germline mutation has bilateral retinublastoma [^wiki1]

#### BRCA
- BRCA:BReast CAncer gene 
	1. BRCA-1: Breast/ovarian cancer
		-  presence of BRCA1 mutation is an indication for prophylactic mastectomy and Oopherectomy: *important in familiak variant of breast cancer*
	2. BRCA-2: Male breast/prostate cancer
- Normal role: involved in DNA repair

#### APC
- The APC protein is a negative regulator that controls beta-catenin concentrations and interacts with E-cadherin [[#^8c95e7]]
- Mutations of APC leads to inactivation of APC thus allowing activating mutations in beta-catenin -> increased MYC activity -> cell proliferation



## Cellular Metabolic Alterations
### Regulators of Apoptosis
- [[class/recall/Core/Pathology/1. Cell Injury]] [[1. Cell Injury#^565948]]
	- BCL2 stabilizes Mitochondrial Outer Membrane - making it impermeable to Cyt C
	- Yoinking (disruption) of BCL2 leads to Cyt. C to leave and activate apoptosis
- In follicular Lymphoma overexpression of BCL2 is overexpressed
	1. This is due to t(14;18)
		- Bcl2 is on chromosome 18
		- IgH is on Chromosome 14
		- BCL2 is now on the ==ON== Chromosome 14 -> overexpression thus the mitochondrial membrane is suuuuuuuper stabilized
		- This is normally okay, coz no apoptosis is... nice
		- But in the follicle, B-cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation to increase diversity in antibodies [[4. Immunity#Proteinaceous Antigens]]
			- Basically Uyghurs getting experimented upon and the shit ones are killed off - except with this mutation they... don't die.... 
			- i.e, naive B-cells that go to lymph node (the college) and then fail to produce antibody -> apoptosis
			- If no apoptosis occurs, then Follicular Lymphoma occurs

- **Altered Autophagy** maybe present depending upon the need of cancer cells


### Upregulation and Downregulation
:::{.sticky-note}
- Telomerase is necessary is required for cell immortality
	- Normally telomeres shorten with cell divisions eventually leading to cellular sensecence : **Hay Flick limit - 60-70 times**
	- Often, cancers have upregulated telomerase, an enzyme that preserves telomeres, normally present in stem and germ cells
- [[#^b55de7]]
- Tumor cells also avoid immune surveillance for survival
	- They do this by downregulating MHC-I of the cells thus CD8+ T Cells cannot detect them
	- They grow antigen negative variant 
	- Secretion of TgF-Beta, IL-10 : **reduced inflammatory response**
	- Secretion of PgE2, VEgF -> T-cell migration is reduced
	- Immune checkpoint bypass through
		- PD-L1 : inhibits T-cell Activation
		- CTLA-4 : removes B7 molecules on APCs (tumor itself here) preventing binding to CD28 [[4. Immunity]]
	- Immunodeficiency (primary or secondary) increases the risk for cancer

### Oncometabolism
- A few enzymes have been revealed to have shown a new mechanism of oncogenenesis
- One such example is the Isocitrate Dehydrogenase - IDH, part of the Kreb's cycle

![[Pasted image 20210707103728.png]]

- 2-HG in turn acts as an inhibitor of several other enzymes that require a metabolite called α-ketoglutarate as a cofactor. 
- Among the proteins that are inhibited by 2-HG are several members of the TET family, including TET2, which are normally responsible for methylation of DNA
- IDH mutation seen in ==glioma, AML, cholongiocarcinoma==

### Immunohistochemistry

- Immunohistochemistry is used to characterize tumors that are difficult to classify on histology
	- An antibody against a particular target is labelled with a brown stain (IHC stain) which then binds to the specific antigen that may help to subclassify the cell type


![[Pasted image 20210706181750.png]]

The most well diff. carcinoid tumor <-> least differentiated small cell carcinoma
	- Differentiated by ==Chromogranin==

### Screening

[[#Screening]]

### Serum Tumor markers
A. Proteins released by tumor into serum (e.g., PSA) 
B. Useful for ==screening==, monitoring response to treatment, and monitoring recurrence 
C. Elevated levels still ***requires tissue biopsy*** for diagnosis of carcinoma (e.g., biopsy of prostate with elevated PSA).

### Grading
A. Microscopic assessment ofdifferentiation (i.e., howmuch a cancer resembles the tissue in which it grows); takes into account architectural and nuclear features 1. Well differentiated (low grade)-resembles normal parent tissue 2. Poorly differentiated (high grade)-does not resemble parent tissue
B. Important for determining prognosis; well-differentiated cancers have better prognosis than poorly-differentiated cancers.

### Staging
A. Assessment ofsize and spread ofa cancer B. Key prognostic factor; more important than grade C. Determined after final surgical resection ofthe tumor D. Utilizes TNM staging system 
1. T - tumor (size and/or depth of invasion) e.g: ``size in breast, depth in bowel``
2. N - spread to regional lymph nodes; second most important prognostic factor
3.  M - metastasis; single ==most important prognostic factor==



# Paraneoplastic Syndromes

- Indigenous hormones

Pourquoi c'est important?
 - Can be an initial manifestation
 - May mimic metastasis
 - May indicate worsening condition

## Endocrinopathies
### 1. Hypercalcemia
- Most common paraneoplastic syndrome
- Presence is due to prostaglandins or parathyroid hormone related peptide
- Seen in:
	- ==**Squamous cell carcinoma**== of lung
	- Kidney cancer
	- Breast cancer

### 2. Cushing syndrome
- A condition that occurs from exposure to high cortisol levels for a long time
- It is seen in carcinoid tumor

## Vascular and Hematological
### 1. Venous Thrombophlebitis
**Thrombophlebitis** (throm-boe-fluh-BY-tis) is an inflammatory process that causes a blood clot to form and block one or more veins
- Mucin is secreted by the tumor
	- This secretion slowly migrates causing migratory venous throbophlebitis
		- This is the **Trousseau** sign of malignancy/ **Trousseau** syndrome [Different from trossaeu sign seen in latent tetany]
		![[Pasted image 20210707145427.png]]
		- a.k.a Thrombophlebitis Migrans

- Seen in AML-M3
- Pancreatic cancer
- Bronchogenic cancer/adenocarcinoma

### 2. Marantic Endocarditis
- A.k.a Non-bacterial Thrombotic Endocardiatis (NBTE)
- Due to secretion of mucin, [[#1 Venous Thrombophlebitis | similar to venous thrombophlebitis]]
- Carcinoma of pancreas
- AML-M3

### 3. Anemia
- Seen in thyoma


## Dermatological 
### Acanthosis nigricans

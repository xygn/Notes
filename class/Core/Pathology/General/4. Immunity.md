Immunity is divided into 
1. Innante
	- Non-specific
	- No memory (amnesic)
2. Adaptive
	- specific
	- Memory (a-amnesic)



# Innate Immunity
1. Barriers
	- Anatomical [skin]
	- Physiological [Secretions and their contents]
		

2. Proteins
	- C-reactive proteins
	- Lectin [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Lectin pathway]]
		- e.g: Mannose Binding Lectins [CD14 of macrophage recognizes]
	- Complement proteins [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Complement System]]
	- Surfactants and plasma proteins

3. Cells
	- Neutrophils
	- Macrophages
	- NK Cellss
		 - Natural Killer (NK) Cells are lymphocytes in the **same family as T and B cells**, coming from a common progenitor. However, as cells of the innate immune system, NK cells are classified as group I Innate Lymphocytes (ILCs) and respond quickly to a wide variety of pathological challenges.
		 - They kill ==virus infected== cells
		 - Kills ==tumor cells==

**How are pathogens recognized?**
## Pattern Recognition receptors
- Bacteria: 
	- Pathogen/Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns
- Inflammation
	- Damage Associated Molecular Patterns

Types:
1.  Toll-like receptor
	- Causes activation of 
		- NF-Kappa-Beta 
			- Causes recruitment of leukocytes
		- IFN-1 (type 1)
			- Antiviral action
]
2.  C-type LR (Lectin Receptor)
	-	Important against fungal infections

### Cytosolic Receptors
1. RIG-like receptor
	- Act against viral nucleic acids
2. NOD-like receptor
	- Identifies:
		- Bacteria
		- K+ levels (eflux)
		- Uric Acid
		- ROS
	- Activates inflammasome
		- Which activates Caspase 1 -> IL1 -> Fever Inflammation
		[[class/Core/Pathology/General/1. Cell Injury#Pyroptosis]]
		


# Adaptive Immunity

- specific
- Memory (a-amnesic)
- Contributed by
	- T-cells - ==Cell-mediated==
		- Effective against intracellular microbeszb
	- B-Cells  - ==Humoral immunity==
		- Effective against extracellular microbes

## B-cells
- Located in the lymph node
	- Spleen
	- GIT
		- Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue ==MALT==
			- Present highly in the Peyer's patches of the Ileum
		- ==Enteric fever== is due to the ulceration of Peyer Patches and thus commonly it's in the ileum
	- Tonsils

- The lymph node has muliple zones
	- Cortex - **B Cells**
	- Paracortex - **T-cells**
	- Medulla **Macrophages**

### B-Cell markers


==CD stands for Cluster of Differentiation==

- CD 1923 (19 to 23) 
	- CD19 - Pan B Marker (present in all stages of B-cell development)
	- CD21 - Receptor for **EBV** (Epstein ***B***arr Virus)
- CD 40
	- CD40 ligand is expressed on the T-cells 
		- CD40L of T-cell and CD40
		- ***B-cell : T-cell interaction***
		- Important in production of high quality antibody formation
- CD80 **/** B7-1 CD86 **/** B7-2 
	- CD80/86 are known as the **B7** (B7-1 and B7-2 respectively)
		- These interact with **CD28** on the T-cell to produce ==co-stimulatory signal==

B-cells on activation -> Plasma-cell
- Plasma cells secrete antibodies (immunoglobulins)
:::

## Immunoglobulins

![[Pasted image 20210707220953.png]]

Made up of:
1. Light Chains
	- λ (lambda)
	- κ (kappa)
> - Normal ratio : 3:1 κ:λ

2. Heavy Chains
	- α (alpha)
	- γ (gamma) 
	- δ (delta)
	- ε (epsilon)
	- μ (mu)

:::{.sticky-note}
- Isotype
	- Different classes of antibodies in the same person
- Allotype
	- Difference in antibody taken from two people
- Idiotype
	- Variable part of antibody is different in same person
:::

### Immunoglobulin Classes / Isotypes
- These are dependent upon the heavy Chains present

### IgG
- Presence of Gamma γ heavy chain
	- ==Maxiumum concentration==
	- Crosses **Placenta**
	- *Complement Activation* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^0c3b7d]]
	- ***Opsonization***

### IgA
- Presence of the Alpha heavy chain
	- Forms:
		1. Monomer in the *Serum*
		2. Dimer in the *Mucosa and Secretions* - joined by **J** joining chain
- ==**First Line of Defense**== (as majority of the infections have to pass through **mucosal** layer)
	- It activates the Alternate pathway *rarely* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Alternate Pathway]]

### IgM
- Presence of mu heavy chain
- M for
	- Max Size
		- ==Pentameric==
	- Max Molecular Weight
- *Complement Pathway Activation* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^0c3b7d]]
	- Primary Immune Response - IgM is mostly produced than IgG (predominant)
- Monomeric form is present on B-Cell Receptor

### IgD
- Presence of Delta Heavy Chain
- Functions as acts as B-cell receptor

### IgE
- Presence of Epsilon Heavy Chain
- Lowest Concentration
- Attached to the surface of Mast Cells [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^a7504d]]
	- Responsible for Type-1 Hypersensitivity Reaction 
- Heat labile antibody


## Antigens

- Exogenous
- Endogenous
- Autogenous

| Types of Antigens based on B-Cell activation              |
| ------------------------------ |
| Non-Proteinaceous              |
| Proteinaceous/T-Cell Dependent |



#### Non-Proteinaceous Antigens
- These are free antigens that do not require any additional cells for activation
	- Thus also known as thymic-independent antigens/T-cell independent
	- **Pentameric** IgM antibodies are produced when bound to **monomeric** form of IgM present on BCR
- Leads to T-cell indepent activation of B-Cell

![[Pasted image 20210707224227.png]]

#### Proteinaceous Antigens

- Requires the support of T-CeLLS for proper activation of Immune System

![[Pasted image 20210707224246.png]]


- B-Cell or APCs (antigen presenting cells) expresses antigen on the surface 
- T-CR (T-cell receptor) then recognizes the antigen
- T-cell then attaches to the MHC class
- CD40(B-cell) and CD40L (T-Cell) interaction occurs
	- This leads to secretion of IL-4/IL-5
	- [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132|Cytokine Reference]]
	- This causes IgM -> IgG/A/E [isotype/class switching : change in heavy chain by IL-4/IL-5]
		- This is *reaaallyy* important for somatic hypermutation ^4e39b6
		- If this is cytokine secretion is blocked -> Hyper IgM syndrome

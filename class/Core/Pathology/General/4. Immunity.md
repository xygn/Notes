Immunity is divided into 
1. Innante
	- Non-specific
	- No memory (amnesic)
2. Adaptive
	- specific
	- Memory (a-amnesic)



# Innate Immunity
1. Barriers
	- Anatomical [skin]
	- Physiological [Secretions and their contents]
		

2. Proteins
	- C-reactive proteins
	- Lectin [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Lectin pathway]]
		- e.g: Mannose Binding Lectins [CD14 of macrophage recognizes]
	- Complement proteins [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Complement System]]
	- Surfactants and plasma proteins

3. Cells
	- Neutrophils
	- Macrophages
	- NK Cells [[#NK Cells]]
		 - Natural Killer (NK) Cells are lymphocytes in the **same family as T and B cells**, coming from a common progenitor. However, as cells of the innate immune system, NK cells are classified as group I Innate Lymphocytes (ILCs) and respond quickly to a wide variety of pathological challenges.
		 - They kill ==virus infected== cells
		 - Kills ==tumor cells==

**How are pathogens recognized?**
## Pattern Recognition receptors
- Bacteria: 
	- Pathogen/Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns
- Inflammation
	- Damage Associated Molecular Patterns

Types:
1.  Toll-like receptor
	- Causes activation of 
		- NF-NF-κB(Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell - a transcription factor)
			- Causes recruitment of leukocytes
			- Activates COX-2
		- IFN-1 (type 1)
			- Antiviral action
]
2.  C-type LR (Lectin Receptor)
	-	Important against fungal infections

### Cytosolic Receptors
1. RIG-like receptor
	- Act against viral nucleic acids
2. NOD-like receptor
	- Identifies:
		- Bacteria
		- K+ levels (eflux)
		- Uric Acid
		- ROS
	- Activates inflammasome
		- Which activates Caspase 1 -> IL1 -> Fever Inflammation
		[[class/Core/Pathology/General/1. Cell Injury#Pyroptosis]]
		

## NK-Cells
==**This is a component of Innate Immunity**==

Hematopoitic Stem Cells -> Lymphoid Stem Cells

- Lymphoid Stem Cells then differentiates
	- In Thymus gland: [[#T Cell]] T cell
	- In Bone Marrow: [[#B-cells]] B-Cell
	- Naive: Natural Killer Cells
		-  Innate Lymphoid Cells

**NK-Cells**
- They can secrete cytokines like T-cells
- They do **not** have TCR
- They were earlier known as Large Granular Lymphocytes [LGL]
- They kill ==virus infected== cells
- Kills ==tumor cells==

![[Pasted image 20210708230309.png|500]]

**Two important receptors**
1. Stimulatory/Activating receptor 
2. Inhibitory Receptor
	- All cells in the body have MHC Class I molecule
	- This stimulates the inhibitory receptor

- MHC class I has reduced expression in mutated cells (tumors) or viruses
[[class/Core/Pathology/General/3. Neoplasia#^c7c179]]
- Virus and cancer tumors have molecules that amplify molecules that activate the Activating receptor

**NK cells also have**
1. CD16
	- Also known as Fc receptor
	- Fc portion of the ImmunoglobulinG attaches to this [[#IgG]]
		- NK-cell destroys the coated antigenic cell
		- Antibody Dependent Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity [**CDCC**]
2. CD56




# Adaptive Immunity

- specific
- Memory (a-amnesic)
- Contributed by
	- T-cells - ==Cell-mediated==
		- Effective against intracellular microbeszb
	- B-Cells  - ==Humoral immunity==
		- Effective against extracellular microbes

## B-cells
- Located in the 
	- Lymph node
	- Spleen
	- GIT
		- Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue ==MALT==
			- Present highly in the Peyer's patches of the Ileum
		- ==Enteric fever== is due to the ulceration of Peyer Patches and thus commonly it's in the ileum
	- Tonsils

- The lymph node has muliple zones
	- Cortex - **B Cells**
	- Paracortex - **T-cells**
	- Medulla **Macrophages**

### B-Cell markers


==CD stands for Cluster of Differentiation==

- CD 19 to 23 (1923) 
	- ==CD19== - Pan B Marker (present in all stages of B-cell development)
	- CD21 - Receptor for **EBV** (Epstein ***B***arr Virus)
- CD 40
	- CD40 ligand is expressed on the T-cells 
		- CD40L of T-cell and CD40
		- ***B-cell : T-cell interaction***
		- Important in production of high quality antibody formation
- CD80 **/** B7-1 CD86 **/** B7-2 
	- CD80/86 are known as the **B7** (B7-1 and B7-2 respectively)
		- These interact with **CD28** on the T-cell to produce ==co-stimulatory signal==

B-cells on activation -> Plasma-cell
- Plasma cells secrete antibodies (immunoglobulins)
:::

## Immunoglobulins

![[Pasted image 20210707220953.png]]

Made up of:
1. Light Chains
	- λ (lambda)
	- κ (kappa)
> - Normal ratio : 3:1 κ:λ

2. Heavy Chains
	- α (alpha)
	- γ (gamma) 
	- δ (delta)
	- ε (epsilon)
	- μ (mu)

:::{.sticky-note}
- Isotype
	- Different classes of antibodies in the same person
- Allotype
	- Difference in antibody taken from two people
- Idiotype
	- Variable part of antibody is different in same person
:::

### Immunoglobulin Classes / Isotypes
- These are dependent upon the heavy Chains present

### IgG

	- ==Maxiumum concentration==
	- Crosses **Placenta**
	- *Complement Activation* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^0c3b7d]]
	- ***Opsonization***

### IgA
- Presence of the Alpha heavy chain
	- Forms:
		1. Monomer in the *Serum*
		2. Dimer in the *Mucosa and Secretions* - joined by **J** joining chain
- ==**First Line of Defense**== (as majority of the infections have to pass through **mucosal** layer)
	- It activates the Alternate pathway *rarely* [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#Alternate Pathway]]

### IgM
- Presence of mu heavy chain

## Antigens

- Exogenous
- Endogenous
- Autogenous

| Types of Antigens based on B-Cell activation              |
| ------------------------------ |
| Non-Proteinaceous              |
| Proteinaceous/T-Cell Dependent |



#### Non-Proteinaceous Antigens
- These are free antigens that do not require any additional cells for activation
	- Thus also known as thymic-independent antigens/T-cell independent
	- **Pentameric** IgM antibodies are produced when bound to **monomeric** form of IgM present on BCR
- Leads to T-cell indepent activation of B-Cell

![[Pasted image 20210707224227.png]]

#### Proteinaceous Antigens

- Requires the support of T-CeLLS for proper activation of Immune System

![[Pasted image 20210707224246.png]]


- B-Cell or APCs (antigen presenting cells) expresses antigen on the surface 
- T-CR (T-cell receptor) then recognizes the antigen
- T-cell then attaches to the MHC class
- CD40(B-cell) and CD40L (T-Cell) interaction occurs
	- This leads to secretion of IL-4/IL-5
	- [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132|Cytokine Reference]]
	- This causes IgM -> IgG/A/E [isotype/class switching : change in heavy chain by IL-4/IL-5]
		- This is *reaaallyy* important for somatic hypermutation ^4e39b6
		- If this is cytokine secretion is blocked -> Hyper IgM syndrome

	- Binds to ***prebound*** antigens only
	- Prebound antigens are presented by APCs
- CD molecules
	- CD 1 to 5, 7 and 8 [CD1 CD2 CD3 CD4 CD5 CD7 CD8]
		- These are all T-cell markers
		- Pan-T-Cell Marker - ==CD3==
			- Significant in signal transduction mechanism
			- Activation of T-cell assisted by calcineurin and IL-2 [[class/Core/Pathology/General/2. Inflammation#^d2a132]]
	- CD28
		- Costimulatory signal from APCs such as B-cells
		- Binds to Ce
	- CD40-**L**

T-Cells can be divided into:
1. CD4+ T Cells - Helper Cells
	- CD4 molecule is present
	- Subtypes
	
		| T Cell type | Reaction                                                   | Secretion of       |
		| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
		| Th1         | Type IV HR                                                 | IL2  and IFN gamma |
		| Th2         | Type I HR                                                  | IL-4 and IL-5      |
		| Th17        | Responsible for Fungal infections and autoimmune disorders | IL-17              |

# Activation of Immune System

- Antigens are divided into
1. Proteinaceous antigens
	- T-Cell dependent
2. Carbohydrate/Lipid Antigens (non-proteinaceous)
	- T-Cell independent


1. Antigen presenting cells internalize antigens and process it
2. APCs then express the antigenic peptide through the MHC molecule
3. MHC molecule is responsible for attachment of antigenic peptide
4. Then APCs enter the systemic circulation and lymphatic circulation
5. Clonal Selection occurs:
	- Only a few T-cells come in contact with specific antigen peptides presented by the APC depending upon the specific antigen

## T-cells:
1. **Effector T-cells**
	- Deals with the presentation
2. **Memory T-cells**
	- These remain dormant after developing antigen receptor
	- Deals with later infection
	- These are fewer in number
	- **CD45RO** is used to detect memory T-Cell
		- CD45 is present on leukocytes
		- Mem**==OR==**y - *Memory device*

## APCs:

### Professional APCs
- These APCs have a very high expression of MHC [^MHC]
1. Dendritic Cells
	- Lang==er==hans cells (tissue resident macrophage) - **Skin and Interstitial Cell**
	- Follicular dendritic cells - ***reservoir for ==HIV==*** present in - **Lymph node and spleen**
2. B-Cells
	- Activated B-cells turn into plasma cells -> secrete antibodies
3. Macrophages


	![[Pasted image 20210701093452.png]]
	- ==CD13, CD14, CD15 and CD33== are CD markers


### Non-Professional APCs
- These are non-standard APCs with low but significant expression of MHC 
1. Fibroblasts
2. Endothelia Cells
3. Thymic epithelial cells
4. Glial Cells
5. Pancreatic Beta-Cells


## MHC
Major Histocompaitibility Complex

- Cell Activated - immune cell activated
- Ag Binding Cleft
### MHC Class I

![[Pasted image 20210709200207.png]]

- Made of 3 alpha chains and 1 beta chain 
- Antigenic cleft is present in between alpha 1 and alpha 2
- Alpha 1 and alpha 2 are distal alpha chains 
- Alpha 3 is proximal alpha chain

> Distal chains form the antigen binding cleft

 - CD8+ T-cells bind to MHC Class I - Endogenous Antigens

### MHC Class II

![[Pasted image 20210709200307.png]]

- Made of two alpha and two beta
- Antigenic cleft is present in between Beta 1 and Alpha 1
- Beta 1 and Alpha 1 are distal chains 
- CD4+ T-cells bind to MHC Class II - Exogenous Antigens
- Most antigens bind to MHC class II

## T-Cell Activation
- There are 2 signals involved
	1. Primary Signal/Signal 1
		- MHC II binding to CD4 receptor
	2. Co-stimulatory signal
		- CD28 on T cell with B7 
			- B7a - CD80
			- B7b - CD86
	- Both signals are required for ==T-cell activation==
		- External antigen provides both signals
		- **Self antigens however** only provide primary signal
			- Co-stimulatory signal is not generated - ==**ANERGY**==
			- This property is known as: Tolerance is exhibited by Self-antigens

C-RP
The normal level of CRP is less than 0.2 mg/dL. However, it increases by several folds in acute inflammatory conditions.  Insignificant increase of CRP (<1 mg/dL): It occurs in conditions such as heavy exercise, common cold, and pregnancy
 Moderate increase (1–10 mg/dL): It occurs in conditions such as bronchitis, cystitis, malignancies, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction
 Marked increase of CRP (>10 mg/dL): It occurs in conditions such as acute bacterial infections, major trauma and systemic vasculitis.
CRP Can be Detected by
	 Precipitation method using C-carbohydrate antigen (obsolete, not in use now)
	 Latex (passive) agglutination test using latex particles coated with anti-CRP antibodies ¾¾ It is the most widely used method employed worldwide ¾¾ Detection limit of CRP by latex agglutination test is 0.6 mg/dL.
Highly Sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) Test 
- Minute quantities of CRP can be detected by various methods (e.g. nephelometry, enzyme immunoassays). This is useful in assessing the risk to cardiovascular diseases

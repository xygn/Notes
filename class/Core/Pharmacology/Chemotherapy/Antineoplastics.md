Anticancer drugs are divided into:
1. Cytotoxic
	- They do not differentiate between host and tumor cells
2. Targeted
	- They are targetted

# Cytotoxic drugs
- They kill rapidly-dividing cells without differentiation
- Lead to:
	- Bone Marrow suppression
	- GIT
		- Cells of GIT are constantly replaced, when this doesn't occur ==diarrhea== from mucositis
	- Alopecia - Hair follicle
	- Purines from cells killed -> Purine release -> Xanthine -> Uric acid : Hyperuricemia
	- Secondary Leukemia [[class/Core/Pathology/General/3. Neoplasia#^f85b3c]]

## Cell Cycle inhibitors

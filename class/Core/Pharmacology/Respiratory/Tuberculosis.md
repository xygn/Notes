What is tuberculosis?
- A multi-systemic desease with myriad


![[Pasted image 20210624140856.png]]

- Inhalation of aerosol droplets containing M.
tuberculosis with subsequent deposition in lungs:
- Immediate clearance of the organism
° Primary disease: immediate onset of active disease
° Latent infection
- Reactivation disease: onset of active disease many years
following a period of latent infection

> Tubercle bacilli -> carried in droplets small enough to
reach alveolar space (5-10 microns) -> innate host
defense system fails to eliminate -> proliferate **inside
alveolar macrophages** -> migrate away from lungs to



## Essentials of Diagnosis
- Fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and cough (dry or productive)
- Risk factors for acquisition:
- Chest radiograph: pulmonary
- Acid-fast bacili


## Goals of treatment
- Decrease mortality and long-term morbidity
- To effect a permanent cure, prevent relapses and decrease transmission
- To minimize development of drug resistance
- To achieve the above while minimizing side-effects

Management consists of a patient-centered approach in which the patient, provider, public health and laboratory enter into a relationship that assures that the goals of treatment are met.

### Drug Susceptibility Testing
- Positivie cultures should be followed by drug susceptibility testing
- Symptoms and radiographic findings do not differentiate between MDR-TB from fully susceptible TB
- Suspect MDR-TB if:
	1. History of previous treatment for TB
	2. Lived in a country with a high prelavance of MDR-TB
	3. In contact with a case of MDR-TB infected
	4. PH (![[Pasted image 20210624142045.png]])

# Anti-tubercular drugs

## Classification
### First Line
HRZE -  abbreviation for Isoniazid, Rifampin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol
- Streptomycin is considered as a reserve drug

#### Isoniazid
- Abbreviated as H / INH
- Essential of all tubercular therapy
- Primarily tuberculoidal
- Fast multiplying organisms are rapidly killed, but quiescent are only inhibited
- Acts on extracellular and intracellular TB (bacilii present within macrophages)
- Equally active in acidic or alkaline medium (during inflammation env. turns acidic)
- Cheapest antitubercular drugs

Mechanism
1. Inhibition of synthesis of mycolic acids (unique fatty acid components of mycobacterial cell wall)
2. Targets -> Two gene products called InhA and KasA (resistance develops at this point)
	- About 1 in million (10^6) is inherently resistant to INH
	- IF INH is given alone, such bacili proliferate selectively and after 2-3 months increase resistant infection
	- Mechanism
		- Mutation of catalase peroxidase (KatG) -> Resistance cannot be overcome -> Stop INH
		- Mutation of inhA gene -> Low-level INH resistance -> can be overcome by using 'high-dose' INh

- no cross resistance

Pharmacokinetics:
- N-acetylation metabolism extensively in liver
	- Fast acetylators [30-40% indians] t-half *1 hour*
	- Slow acetylators [60-70%] t-half of *3 hour*
Acetylator status does not matter if INH is taken daily

Adverse effects:
- Peripheral neuritis
	- Dose dependent
	- Prevented by pyridoxine (10mg/day)
	- Treatment by pyridoxidine (100mg/day) [10x prophylaxis]

- Hepatitis
	- Rare in children
	- Reversible
	- Common in older and  alcoholics

#### Rifampicin
- A.k.a Rifampin
- Obtained from Streptomyces mediterranei
- Bactericidal against M. tuberculosis and leprae
	- And also Many other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria like Staph. aureus, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Legionella
- Acts best on slowly/intermittently dividing ones (spurters)
- both extra and intracellular bacilii

MOA
- Inhibits RNA synthesis by binding to mycobacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (encoded by rpoB gene) and blocking its polymerizing function
- Mammalian RNA polymerase does not avidly bind to rifampicin

Resistance
- Resistance develops rather rapidly
- Incidence of resistant bacili 10^-7
- Primary rifampin resistant tubercular infection is unusual
- In india - 2%
- It is due to mutation in rpoB gene reducing its affinity
- No cross resistance with other antituberculars except 

PK
- Orally
- Bioavailability - 70%
- Food decreases absorption -> thus taken on empty stomach
- Penetrates intracellulary -> enters tubercular cavities, caseous masses and placenta
- Crosses meninges and largely lpumped out from P
- Metabolized in liver -> Excreted in bile and urine

Drug interactions
- Induces several CYP450 isoenzymes
	- Increases metabolism of many drugs including itself
	![[Pasted image 20210624144457.png]]
	
Adberse
- Hepatotoxicity
	- Dose related
	- If jaundice - continues
- Minor reaction [does not requiring drug withdrawal]
	- Cutaneous: flushing, pruritus + rash, redness and watering eyes
	- Flu like symptoms: chills,
	- Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
	- Urine/secretions may become orange-red -> **Harmless**

Other uses
- Leprosy
- prophylaxis of 
- 2nd/3rd DOC of
- Doxycyline + rifampacin -> first in Brucellossis

#### Pyrazinamide (Z)
- Tuberculocidal but weaker than ING
- More active in acidic medium


- Highly effective during first 2 months when inflammatory changes are present
- Good sterilziing activity
- Inclusion of pyrazinamide
	- Shortened duration of treatment
	- Reduces risk of relapse

MOA
- Not well established
- Pyrazinamide -> pyraz


ADR
- Hepatotoxicity
	- Dose related
	- Less common in Indian population
	- Daily dose is limited to 25-30

#### Ethambutol
- Only tuberculostatic in FL
- Fast 

MOA
- Not fully understood
- Interferes wit MAcid incorparation into wall

ADR
- Retrobulbar neuritis:
	- Loss of visual acuity/color vision, field defects
	- Stop at first indication of visual impairment
	- Young children were previously contraindicated, but now wit
	- Early recognition + stoppage -> Largely reverisble
	- Safe in pregnancy

Useful in MAC

#### Streptomycin

![[Pasted image 20210624145607.png]]
- Supplemental first line



### Second Line
#### 

#### Fluroquinones

#### Other oral drugs

#### Injectible drugs



## Other classification

![[Pasted image 20210624142434.png]]


- Bactericidal: drugs that kill the bacilli in vivo
	- All first line drugs are bactericidal except **Ethambutol** (which is bacteriostatic)
	
Bacteriostatic: Inhibits multiplication -> their destruction depends on the immune mechanism of the host:
	- Ethambutol
	- Thioacetazone
	
Two phase therapy
1. Intensive Phase
	- Aims for rapid killing of bacili
2. Continuation Phase
	- Sterilizing smaller number of dormant/persistent bacilii
	- Multi-drug regimens and DOT necessary (unless R not used) even though the risk of drug resistence

# Ramycing
# Fluroquinolines
# Rifabutin
- Less active against M. Tuberculosis, more active against MAC
- Less potential for **drug interactions**
- Prevention of dissemin

# Rifapentine
- Potent enzyme inducer
- Not suitable for use during the intensive phase
- Indication (600 mg once/twice weekly)
- Mechanism

# Bedaquiline
- Novel mechanism: Inhibits mycobacterial **ATP synthase** thereby limiting energy production within mycobacteria
- Human ATPsynthase: 20000 less sensitive than mycobacterial enzyme

- Kill both rapid and dormant
- Resistance:
	- Mutation
	- BDQ efflux'
- Fatty meals improves absorption

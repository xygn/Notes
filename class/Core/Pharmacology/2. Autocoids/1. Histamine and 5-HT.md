## H1 Blockers
1. First generation Anti-histamincs
	- Crosses Blood-brain barrier
	- Can cause sedation - Thus contraindicated in 
	- Anticholenergic properties - thus for indications such as 
		- Motion sickness
		- Drug-induced parkinsonism
		- Muscular Dystonias
	- However side-effects 

**Adverse Effects**
	- Sedation, drowsiness, lack of concentration, headache, fatigue
	- Psychomotor incoordination
	- GIE - nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), epigastric discomfort
	- Anticholinergic sideffects such as: cause dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, constipation, urinary retention.
	
**Uses**

> - Allergic conditions
> - Insect bite, ivy poisoning, and to prevent histamine release
> - P - Possess - Parkinsonism
> - A - Anti - Acute Muscular Dystonia
> - C - Cholinergic - Common Cold
> - P - Properties - Prophylaxis of motion sickness

2.  Second generation
	- Cannot cross blood brain barrier - thus no sedation
	- No Anti-cholinergic activity
	- Useful only for allergy
	- Cetirizine - an active metabolite of hydroxyzine (1st gen H1 Blocker) is one of the commonly used second-generation antihistamines. In addition to H1 -blocking effect, it can also inhibit the release of histamine. It causes minimal/or no drowsiness. It is not metabolized in the body. Incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is rare with this drug.
		- Levo-cetrizine, a L-isomer is more potent and less sedative

3. Third generation:
	- Some authorities describe the term 3rd generation antihistaminics for the active enantiomer (like levo-cetirizine) or metabolite (e.g. desloratidine and fexofenadine) of 2nd generation drugs.

> Cisapride
> Astemizole
> Terfenadine
> These drugs are withdrawn due to cause of Torsades de pointes
> Metabolized by 3A4 enzyme, thus inducers led to toxicity

## Migraine
- Unilateral pulsatile headache
- Inflammation and  dilatation of  blood vessels of the brain
- Calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) is released from the trigeminal nerve
	- Causes inflammation
	- Powerful vasodilator

> - DOC is NSAIDs
> - -triptans (serotonin (5-HT1) receptor agonists, sumatriptan derivatives) are DOC for severe acute attacks

**5HT1B/1D**

- Triptans stimulatates this receptor
- It causes vasoconstriction  in the blood vessel
- It inhibits the release of CGRP from trigeminal nerve

- Ergotamine also stimulates 5Ht1B/D
	- However increased vomitting is associated thus they aren't preferred
- Ergotamine and triptans should not be given together

> - Coronary artery spasm is a possible sideeffect due to vasoconstriction
> - Thus avoided in patients with Coronary Artery Disease

| C        | Calcium Channel Blockers | Flunarizine                                  |
|          | CGRP MABs                | Erenumab, Framanezumab, Galcanezumab         |
| of       |                          |                                              |
| Migraine |                          | Methysergide - risk of pulmonary fibrosis    |
|          | MABs                     | Eren-umab, Framanezumab, Galcanezumab        | 




- Calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) is released from the trigeminal nerve - which has 5HT1B/1D and  5HT1F
	- 5-HT1F stimulation leads to decreased CGRP and prevents from vasodilation and 
	- e.g: Lasmiditan - part of **ditans**
	- Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists -GEPAnt 
		- Olcegepant

Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism in which plasma urate concentration is raised either due to overproduction or impaired excretion of uric acid. It is characterized by intermittent attacks of acute arthritis produced by deposition of sodium urate crystals in joints.

Primary hyperuricaemia may be idiopathic or due to enzyme defects. Secondary hyperuricaemia can occur in leukaemias, chronic renal failure and during drug therapy (thiazides, loop diuretics, pyrazinamide, levodopa, cytotoxic agents, etc.

- Gout is caused by Hyperuricemia and it is of two types:
	1. Acute
		- Uric acid levels in blood is raised
		- Affects only 1-3 joints are affected
		- Pain and inflammation
		- Most commonly involved joint: Metacarpophalyngeal
	2. Chronic
		- Perioidic episodes of gout pain
		- More than 2 attacks per year

For acute gout
- NSAIDs [DOC] except Aspirin
- Steroids
- Colchicine - most effective
	- it is not the drug of choice is due to its side effects
	- Myopathy and Severe Diarrhea

For chronic gout:

1. Uric acid synthesis inhibitors: Decrease formation of uric acid
	- Allopurinol - [DOC]
		- Causes allergy in few people
	- Febuxostat
		- Makes Xanthine Oxidase Static - ``XO Stat``
2. Uricosuric agents: Increase excretion of uric acid
	- Probenecid
	- Sulphinpyrazone
	- Benzbromarone
	- Lesinurad
3. Further metabolism of Uric Acid:
	- Uricase enzyme in birds metabolize uric acid into Allantoin, a water-soluble metabolite
	- Similarly, the drug ==Rasburicase== ```RecombinAnt Bird URciase```
	- ==Pegloticase== is also used

- Consumption of water is necessary for consumption of uricosuric agents as uric acid is not water soluble. High fluid intake is advised to prevent formation of urate crystals in urine and kidneys.

# Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown cause. Although there are a variety of systemic manifestations, the main characteristic feature is persistent inflammatory synovitis of peripheral smaller joints. The course of the disease is prolonged with exacerbation and remissions. Pain and swelling of the joints are mainly due to PGs, whereas cytokines are responsible for progressive damage to the joints leading to deformity.

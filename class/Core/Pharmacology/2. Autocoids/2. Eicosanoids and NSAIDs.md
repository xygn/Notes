> PA Integration: [[class/recall/Core/Pathology/2. Inflammation#Arachidonic Acid]]

- AA - 20C FA - 4 Double bonds
- LT - 4Double bonds
- PG - Cyclization occurs thus only 2 double bonds (endogenous)
	- Synthetic PGs like Misoprostol  and Alprostadil (PGE1) have 1 double bond ^da623c
- Cyclooxygenase enzyme converts the straight chain fatty acid -> cycIe in which 2 double bonds break andform Prostaglandins with 2 doubie bonds.

				Ductus arterious is a connection in the intrauterine life connecting Pulmonary Trunk to Aorta

**PDA** - condition where ductus arteriosus hasn't regressed
- Treatment involves inhibition of production of PGE2
	1. Aspirin
	2. Indomethacin
	3. Ibuprofen
- During treatment of [Transposition of Great Vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels), ductus arteriosus is needed to be kept open for the surgery
	- This is done by giving PGE1 (PGE2 analogue)[[#^da623c |  synthetic prostaglandins]] like Alprostadil


- Abortion uses [[#^88146a | PGE2, PGF2]] to contract upper part and  relax the lower part Misoprostol - PGE1 (PGE2 analogue)
	- Similarly Misoprostol is also used for cervical ripening in induction of labor for relaxation of lower segment of the uterus and cervic

- Postpartum bleeding usually stops due to uterine contractions
	- In some cases the contractions are weak -> Postpartum hemorrhage
	- Carboprost PGF2 alpha - **DOC is Oxytocin**


- Cox Inhibitors induce peptic ulcers due to p
	- For ulcer, most specific drug caused by NSAID-induced peptic ulcer - Misoprostol
	- However DOC -> Proton Pump Inhibitors

- For primary open angle glaucoma, latanoprost a PGF2alpha analogue is given -**DOC**
	- Side effects
		- P: Pigmentation of iris (Heterochroma iridis)
		- G: Growth of eye lashes (Hypertrichosis)
		- F2 alpha: Fluid in Macula (Macular Edema)

# NSAIDS

- NSAIDs - Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

| Cyclooxygenase 1                     | Cyclooxygenase 2                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constitutive enzyme                  | Inducible enzyme                                                      |
| Present at most places               | Induction at site of inflammation                                     |
| COX-1 maybe induced at lesser degree | They may be present in the kidney, endothelium and CNS constitutively | 



| Non-selective COX inhibitors           | Selective COX-2 Inhibitors                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increased risk of Peptic Ulcer disease | Lesser risk of PUD as COX-1 will produce PGE2 in the stomach |
| Examples                               |                                                              |

| Drug                        | Effect                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Aspirin                     |                                        |
| Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) | No Anti-inflammatory activity          | 
| Ibuprofen                   | DOC NSAID in Children                  |
| Diclofenac                  |                                        |
| Indomethacin                | Causes Sedatiob - contraindication     |
| Piroxicam                   | Long-acting due to enterohepatic cycle |
| Phenylbutazone              |                                        |



## Paracetamol

- Peroxide theory
	- At site of inflammation, ROS like H202 are formed
	- In presence of H202, Acetaminophen does not exhibit activity
	- Thus anti-inflammatory effect is absent

- To explain lesser PUD risk
	- COX-3 inhibition theory
	- COX-3 is present mainly in the CNS
	- As pain and fever is a central effect and inflammation is peripheral
	- Since it's not anti-inflammatory, it's antipyretic and analgesic (thus not a DOC NSAID for children)

- Paracetomol's metabolite acts on vanilloid receptors (TRPV) -> responsible for Analgesic action

> Post-metabolism, 99% of paracetamol is inactive
> - Acetaminophen -> [CYP] ->N-Acetyl para-amino benzo quinone imine (NAPQI)
>  NAPQI has high affinity for -SH groups
>  -  The glutathione produced by liver binds with NAPQI and neutralizes it

- Thus paracetamol toxicity can occur when
	1. Overdosage
	2. Liver disease
	3. Chronic Alcholism
- N-Acetyl Cysteine is given as a DOC for Paracetamol toxicity -> contains -SH groups

## Asprin

- Irreversible COX Non-selective inhibitor

[[#^fc3b23]]

> Aspirin prevents formation of PGH2 by irreversibly binding
> - Because TxA2 is produced by activated platelets - that do not have a nucleus thus there's no transcription -> COX enzyme production is not renewed
> - However PGI2 synthesis occurs in endothelial cells, which do have a nucleas and upregulate the production of Cyclooxygenase
> - This thus causes the anti-platelet-aggregatory effect of Aspirin

-  It is contraindicated in children with viral infection due to risk of Reye's syndrome
-  Can cause hyperuricemia at therapeutic doses -> **Avoided** in gout

- **Salicylism** - OD of aspirin
	1. Stimulation of respiratory center
	2. -> Hyperventiltion -> decreased CO2
	3. -> Respiratory Alkalosis - **Reversible till here**
	4. Metabolic Acidosis - **Irreversible step**
		- Due to compensation -> removal of bicarbonate
		- Due to hyperventilation -> Lactic acid metabolites
		- Aspirin itself is an acidic drug
	- Treatment
		- Sodium Bicarbonate
			- Alkalizes urine
			- Reverses metabolic acidosis
			- Helps in aspirin excretion

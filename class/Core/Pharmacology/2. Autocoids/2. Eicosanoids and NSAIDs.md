- AA - 20C FA - 4 Double bonds
- LT - 4Double bonds
- PG - Cyclization occurs thus only 2 double bonds (endogenous)
	- Synthetic PGs like Misoprostol  and Alprostadil (PGE1) have 1 double bond ^da623c
- Cyclooxygenase enzyme converts the straight chain fatty acid -> cycIe in which 2 double bonds break andform Prostaglandins with 2 doubie bonds.

> Aspirin prevents formation of PGH2 by irreversibly binding
> - Because TxA2 is produced by activated platelets - that do not have a nucleus thus there's no transcription -> COX enzyme production is not renewed
> - However PGI2 synthesis occurs in endothelial cells, which do have a nucleas and upregulate the production of Cyclooxygenase
> - This thus causes the anti-platelet-aggregatory effect of Aspirin


| Effects                                          | Prostaglandin           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Fever - Pain and inflammation                    | PGE2                    |
| Platelet aggregation                             | TxA2                    |
| Inhibition of platelet aggregation               | PGI2                    |
| Ductus Arteriosus (IUL) is kept open             | PGE2                    |
| Vasodilation                                     | PGI2 (Iloprost), PGE2   |
| Upper Uterine segment contraction                | PGE2, PGF2alpha         |
| Relaxes Lower segment                            | PGE2                    |
| Inhibits proton pump inhibitor of stomach        | PGE2                    |
| Mucous and Bicarbonates are increased in stomach | PGE2                    |
| Vasodilation -> Blood flow is increased          | PGE2                    |
| Uveo-cleral outflow is increased                 | PGF2alpha (Latanoprost) |

				Ductus arterious is a connection in the intrauterine life connecting Pulmonary Trunk to Aorta

**PDA** - condition where ductus arteriosus hasn't regressed
- Treatment involves inhibition of production of PGE2
	1. Aspirin
	2. Indomethacin
	3. Ibuprofen
- During treatment of [Transposition of Great Vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels), ductus arteriosus is needed to be kept open for the surgery
	- This is done by giving PGE1 (PGE2 analogue)[[#^da623c |  synthetic prostaglandins]] like Alprostadil


- Abortion uses [[#^88146a | PGE2, PGF2]] to contract upper part and  relax the lower part Misoprostol - PGE1 (PGE2 analogue)
	- Similarly Misoprostol is also used for cervical ripening in induction of labor for relaxation of lower segment of the uterus and cervic

- Postpartum bleeding usually stops due to uterine contractions
	- In some cases the contractions are weak -> Postpartum hemorrhage
	- Carboprost PGF2 alpha - **DOC is Oxytocin**


- Cox Inhibitors induce peptic ulcers due to p
	- For ulcer, most specific drug caused by NSAID-induced peptic ulcer - Misoprostol
	- However DOC -> Proton Pump Inhibitors

- For primary open angle glaucoma, latanoprost a PGF2alpha analogue is given -**DOC**
	- Side effects
		- P: Pigmentation of iris (Heterochroma iridis)
		- G: Growth of eye lashes (Hypertrichosis)
		- F2 alpha: Fluid in Macula (Macular Edema)

- NSAIDs - Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

| Cyclooxygenase 1                     | Cyclooxygenase 2                                                      |

| Constitutive enzyme                  | Inducible enzyme                                                      |
| Present at most places               | Induction at site of inflammation                                     |
| COX-1 maybe induced at lesser degree | They may be present in the kidney, endothelium and CNS constitutively | 



| Non-selective COX inhibitors           | Selective COX-2 Inhibitors                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increased risk of Peptic Ulcer disease | Lesser risk of PUD as COX-1 will produce PGE2 in the stomach |

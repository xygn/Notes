## Electrophysiology
Cardiac cell tissue is divided
Physiological division:
- Contractile -> Myocytes
- Pacemaker/Conducting -> Sino-atrial node and Atrioventricular Node

Electrophysiologically:
- SLow conducting tissue
- Fast conducting tissue -> Conducting tissue

Channels:
Different types
L type @ -40mV
T type calcium
voltage K+ 

Depolarization: Entry through Na+ at resting stage
Hyperpolarization -> Exit of K+ through K+ channel at resting stage
Repolarization -> Exit of K+ through K+ channel at Depolarized state

Events of polarity in Nodal Tissue
- @-40mV rapid depolarization
- Phase 4 -  Phase 4 is not resting, because of funny current due to leakage of Na+ and K+ into the cells until it depolarizes
- Phase 0 - L-type Calcium channels open -> Inward current -> Leads to depolarization | 
- Phase 3 - Inactivation of Ca++ channels | K+ Channels open -> outward current -> repolarization
![[Pasted image 20210620155626.png | 400]]
- **In AV Node**, Phase 4 is slower
- SA node is dominant due to it's quicker Phase 4
- No inward rectifying channels in pace-maker

Resting MP of myocyte - -90mV
of Nodal tissue -60 mV

Events of polarity in Myocyte
- Phase 4 - Closed Na+ and Ca++ (resting state) [There's a constant outward leak of K+ via electropotential gradient | Countering this -> Inward rectifying ]
- When action potential is triggered in neighboring cells, sodium rushes into the RP through the gap junctions
- Phase 0 - Na+ opens [CLASS 1 AR] 
- Phase 1 - Na+ closes, K+ opens
- Phase 2 - Opening of K+ and L-type Calcium channel -> Inward **Ca2+** current which is the trigger for myocyte contraction
- Phase 3 - Continuous exit of K+ channel, calcium channel closed
> Na influx -> Ca influx -> K+ efflux -> Na efflux -> K+ influx -> K+ equilibrium

0. Depolarization depends on Ca2+ and Na+
1. Repolarization mainly depends on K+ (delayed rectifier type)
	- Slower
	- Denotes the refractory period of cardiac tissue
2. Resting phase - depends on K+ leakage and inward rectifying current
	- Denotes automaticity in case of SAN/AVN

Antiarrythmics - try to normalize ionic fluxes

WHat is arrythmia?
- Ionic fluxes are changed leading to changes in the rhythm of heart

Broadly classified as:
1. Bradyarrythmia (less than 60 beats)
	- Mostly due to impaired conduction
2. Tachyarytmia (greater than 100 beats)
	1. Narrow QRS complex (Supraventricular Tachyarythmia) [QRS < 0.12s]
		- **Sinus tachycardia**: increased impulses from SAN
		- **Atrial premature bea**t: atrial contractions triggered by ectopic foci rather than the sinoatrial node. Here it originates from the atrial myocardium causing a skipped beat
		- **Atrial tachycardia:** atrial contractions triggered by ectopic foci rather than the sinoatrial node. Here it originates from the atrial myocardium causing it to beat faster
		- **Atrial flutter**: due to reentry phenomenon
		- **Atrial fibrillation**: when an entire chamber of the heart is involved in multiple micro-reentry circuits and is, therefore, quivering with chaotic electrical impulses, it is said to be in fibrillation.
	2.  Wide QRS complex tachycardias [QRS >0.12s]
		- Ventricular premature beat/Ventricular extrasystole: [Premature ventricular contractions (PVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ventricular_contraction)
		- Ventricular tachycardia: Ventricular contractions triggered by re-entry electrical circuit. Here it originates from the atrial myocardium causing it to beat faster
		- Ventricular fibrillation: can be disrupted by re-entry → chaotic, circulating excitation of the myocardium (= ventricular fibrillation); → simultaneous contractions at multiple foci → insufficient cardiac output → hemodynamic collapse → loss of consciousness and possibly death (sudden cardiac death)
		- Torsades de pointes:  Uncommon and distinctive form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 

## Mechanisms of Arrythmias
**Abnormal impulse genneration**
- Ectopic impulse - due to adrenergic system, hypokalemia etc
- Enhanced Automaticity

**Abnormal Impulse Conduction**
 - Anatomical reentry
 - Functional reentry

**Triggered activity**
- Delayed after depolarization: A beat that is delayed for a while even after depolarization
- Early after depolarization: A beat that is seen before completion of repolarization

### Anatomicaly defined Reentry
What is it?
A re-entrance circuit either due to anatomical reasons or physiologic
- an anatomical barrier leads to occurrence as an accessory pathway
Accessory pathway connects atrium and ventricle
Pathway is different from normal one (AV/Purkinje system)
But it is nearly parallel
As a result, rhythm of heart is affected due to reentry of impulses even before next Action potential is generated.
- These tissues have higher refractory periods
- Connected proximally and distally
- With different electrophysiological and conductive properties

### Functionally defined Rentry
What is it?
- There is no fixed pathway/accessory tissue
- A premature impulse travels through inhomogenous medium causing a differing velocity
- There could be multiple functional foci as ischemia progresses
- Causes:

### Re-entry phenomenon
1. Two roughly parallel conducting pathways must be present
2. Connected proximally and distally by conducting tissue, forming a potential circuit
3. One pathway must have a longer refractory period than the other
4. Pathway with  shorter refractory period must conduct electrical impulses (rate and conduction) slow enough that the opposite pathway re-joins the main one when it is excitable

### Intiation of rentry

## Types of Arythmias
 **Supraventricular**
- Atrial Fibrillation
	- Irregularly irregular pulse
	- Baseline in EKG is wavy 
	- Absence of clearly defined P-wave
	Rate Control (<110bpm), Usually CCBs, Digoxin, Beta blockers
	Chemical cardioversion is done by Ibutilide (Class 3 AR) [Less used]
	Rhythm Control - Class 1 and Class 3
- Atrial Flutter
	- Flutter waves in the EKG
	- Organized depolarization compared to fibrillation -> circuit usually within the right atrium
- Paroxysmal (comes and goes) supraventricular tachycardia [Sudden onset - Electrical activity originates above ventricular]
 **Ventricular**
- Ventricular fibrillation and flutter
- Ventricular tachycardiad

## Treatment
- Na+ blockers decreases slope(dv/dt) of Phase 0 
- K+ blockers increases the AP duration (QT interval increased) 
- K+ openers decrease the AP duration (QT interval)
> **Torsades' de pointes** - twisting of the points | Feared outcome of QT prolongation
> - Uncommon and distinctive form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)
> - Class IA and III (K+ blockers) - QT-prolongation drugs cause thus

# Classification of Anti-arrythmics
***Vaughan William Classification***
1. [[#Class 1 Sodium channel blocker]]
	- [[#Class 1A]]
	- [[#Class IB]]
	- [[#Class 1C]]
2. [[#Class 2 Beta blockers]]
3. [[#Class 3 Agent widening action potential]]
4. [[#Class 4 Calcium channel blocker]]
5. [[#Class 5 Miscellaneous]]
Actions may overlap and not be a sole ion channel blocker. - multiple actions
![[Pasted image 20210624215033.png]]
## How do they work:
- Change shape of Cardiac AP
- Class 1 and 3 (Na and K) mostly exert their effect on myocytes
 ![[Pasted image 20210620171019.png]]
- Class 2 and 4 (Beta blockers and CCB) mostly exert their effect on Nodal tissue
![[Pasted image 20210620171129.png]]

### Class 1: Sodium channel blocker
These reduce the sodium current o
- Lengthens QRS 
- ![[Pasted image 20210620171623.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20210620171750.png]]
- Use dependance of Class I: Na-channel **open/inactive state** ,i.e., there is binding to open/inactive state
	- Thus in tachycardia, since the heart rate is higher, the state dependency is met more often
	- Thus more binding at fast heart rates, most frequently in 1C

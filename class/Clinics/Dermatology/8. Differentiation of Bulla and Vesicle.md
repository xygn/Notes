Tinea capitis - head
	- Usually seen in kids; sebum acts as antifungal in adults
- black dots tinea capitis: multiple tiny dots on 

![[Pasted image 20210625102324.png]]
Kerion: it is inflammatory boggy swelling with pustules on top (the pustules are due to focal FUNGUS)

Tinea pedis: feet
Tinea unuguium

Myecatoma: Madura foot
- eumycotic(true mycotic) colonies


# Bullae and Vesicles
- Vesicle is a clear-fluid filled lesion less than 0.5cm in diameter
- Bullae is of greater than 0.5cm

may be due to gemnetic mutation or autoimmune blistering response (genetic blisters)

- Vesicle rupture -> Erosion (secondary infection)
Vesicles can come in infection
	- e.g: chickenpox
	- Herpes
	- Early stage of impatito
	- scarring in chickenpox is common due to 	
	- Herpes simplex: labialis - lips
								  genitalis - s
- Bulla-something sign Picture insert

Tzanck smear:

- large rounded cells
	- Nucleus is larger
	- Multinucleated giant cells (epidermal keratinocytes that have become one and integrated)
	- Classical for viral infections: chickenpox/herpesvirus
	- Owl-eye appearance
	

- Acantholytic cells

- Pemphigas vulgaris: autoimmune 
	- T
	- Fish-net pattern in immunoflorescence

Chickenpox
-	Dew drop on rose petal appearance (fluid-filled vesicles on erythrematous background)


## Bulla

- Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 and 2 are present in the basement membrane

# HW
- Cytopathic effect in herpes virus and varicella zoester

1. What is cytopathic effect: structural changes in a host cell resulting from viral infection.
2. In herpes virus:
	- Characteristic cytopathologic changes resulting from HSV infection include 
	- ballooning of infected cells, 
	- production of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies, 
	- migration of chromatin, 
	- formation of multinucleated giant cells
>Brooks, G.F., Butel, J.S., Morse, S.A., 2004. Jawetz, Melnick and Adelberg’s Medical Microbiology, 23rd ed. McGraw-Hill Company, Singapore, pp. 429–438

3. In varicella zoster
	- characterized by the formation of large multinucleated syncytia
	- little intercellular molding

Competency addressed
Identifying candida from skin scraping and KOH staining

#### Skin scraping to identify fungal hyphae
Steps:
1. Glass slide and scalpel
2. Scrape the lesion 
3. Scales are obtained from the glass slide
4. KOH is put onto the scale specimen - keratin dissolves
5. Cover slip is put on iut
6.  FIll it again
7.  Leave it for 30 minutes
8.  Under light microscope 10x and higher

*KOH test on a [vaginal wet mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_wet_mount "Vaginal wet mount"), showing slings of pseudohyphae of _[Candida albicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans)_ surrounded by round vaginal epithelial cells, conferring a diagnosis of [candidal vulvovaginitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidal_vulvovaginitis "Candidal vulvovaginitis").*

The **KOH Test for _Candida albicans_**, also known as a [potassium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide "Potassium hydroxide") preparation or **KOH prep**, is a quick, inexpensive fungal test to differentiate [dermatophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophyte) and _[Candida albicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans "Candida albicans")_ symptoms from other skin disorders like [psoriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis "Psoriasis") and [eczema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema "Tinea unguium").


Other stainsL
#### Fungal infection

Common places of infection
- Skin
- Hair
- Nail
Combination of any may happen
- #Candida - mucocutaneous area: tongue, buccous, genital region
- vulvovaginitis
(balanitis: inflammation of glans penis)
(Posthitis: involving the prepuce)
(balanoposthitis: both - associated with diabetes melitus)
chronic mucotrigocandiadis
oral thrush in intertrigo
- #Dermatophyte
3 genera of Dermatophytes (*require keratin for growth*): Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. 
Causes:

Candida risk factors:
- Immunocompression (HIV, Cancer chemotherapy[Anti-metabolites])
- Malignancy
- **It's an oppurtinistic infection**

#Tinea:
- cruris - 
- mannum- hand
- something-
- pedis - feet (including dorsal and interdigital)
- intertrigo (groin, axilla - skinfolds)

#### Deep fungal infection
Mucormycosis - black fungus (*linked to immunosuppressive treatment for COVID-19*)
Mycetoma - Mycetoma is a chronic disease usually of the foot but any part of the body can be affected. Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation of certain fungi or bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue.

### Diagnosis
- Tissue biopsy

### Treatment
- Antifungals 
1. Azoles

Oral or topical
##### Oral
Traziazoles, ketacazoles, oricanazoles

##### Topical
Clotrimazole, ketacanazole, terbinafine

# HW 
When you examine under wood lamp, Pityriasis versicolor/tinea versicolor/what is the fluorescence, differential with okay erythrasma(?)
- amber yellow
- ertytramsma: pink/red - it is a corynebacterial infection

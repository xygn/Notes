## Basic Concepts
> 55% | 47% | 25s /Q
- Signalling pathways that trigger hypertrophy activate transcription factors such as
	1. GATA 4
	2. Nuclear factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT)
	3. Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2)
- Glutaraldehyde is the most commonly used fixative for electron microscopy
- 10% neutral buffered Formalin is most commonly used fixative for light microscopic
- Lipids in the tissue are detected by Oil Red O (histologic stain) #histology
- Mallory bodies are composed of interwoven bundles of cytoskeletol intermediate filaments (cytokeratins)
- The pancreas of fetus (of diabetic mothers) may undergo hyperplasia due to increased demand.
			This is because islets of pancreas have proliferative capacity during fetal development
- Hydropic swelling reflects the acute, reversible cell injury
Plasma membrane sodium transport is impaired due to unavailability of ATP
- Cellular ageing is inflenced by:
	1.  DNA damage -> causes mutatuin
	2.  Telomere shortening -> cellular replication reduced -> cell loss
	3.  Defective protein **homeostasis** -> Both normal folding and degradation of misfolded proteins are impaired with aging
	4.  Dysregulated nutrient sensing -> Mediators may be reduced IGF-1 signaling and increase sirutins

## Reversible cell injury
>48% | 57% | 19 s/Q
- Breast does not undergo both hypertrophy and hyperplasia during lactation -> prolactin and estrogen only cause hypertrophy
	- However during pregnancy and puberty it does undergo both

- In Fenton reaction, iron is converted from ferrous to ferric form, and a hydroxyl radical is generated

- Pleomorphic adenoma are the most common salivary gland neoplasms
	- Mixed tumor - Epithelial + Mesenchymal component
	- Warthin tumor is the 2nd most common neoplasm
	- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of salivary glands
- Ground glass hepatocytes are seen in chronic hepatits B
	- Autoimmune hepatitis features
		1. Autoantibodies
		2. IgG level increased (1.1x)
		3. Histology of liver
		 	- In interface hepatitis: Lymphocytic/lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in portal cells and extending in the lobule
		 	- Emperipolesis: Active penetration by one cell into another and through a larger cell (cell within a cell)
			 - Hepatic rosette formation
		4. Absence of viral hepatits


- Kayorrhexis is a feature of necrosi (irreversible cell injury)
- Inflammasome is mediated by IL-1β
	- It's a cytosolic multiprotein complex consisting of NLRP-3 sensor, an adaptor and inactive Caspase-1 enzyme	
	- It's triggered by NOD-like receptors (NLRs) that sense the ingested microbial particles
	- NLRs signals activate IL-1β, cleaving it from precursor form -> biologically active form

## Irreversible Cell Injury/Necrosis
> 77% | 65% | 21 S/Q
- Micro-RNAs are non-coding RNAs 21-30 nucleotides in length
- Metastatic calcification is prone to organs that have an internal alkaline component
- Cellular maturation shows abnormal pattern in dysplasia which is preneoplastic
- Abscess is a clear example of liquefactive infarct as a cavity is formed by liquefaction of solid tissue
- **Ghon's complex** is a lesion seen in the lung that is caused by tuberculosis
- Nuclear features are hallmark of necrosis, other features like cytoplasmic swelling can be of both
- Extracted DNA from apoptotic cells gives a ladder pattern in electrophoresis
- Pyogenic Infection: infection that produces pus - 
- Pyroptosis causes highly inflammatory form of death

## Apoptosis
> 87% | 84% | 19s /q
- Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes/zymogens
- Platlet degranulation is a component of primary hemostasis
- Councilman body - Apoptotic hepatocytes
- FasL is not involved in INTRINISC PATHWAY
- LC3 is involved in Autophagy
- Efferocytosis: Apoptotic cell phagocytposis -occurs because of Cq1 coated that attracts **macrophages**

## Free Radical Injury
- SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) protects from production of free radicals
